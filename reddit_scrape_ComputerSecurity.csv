,ComputerSecurity,"How the ThinkPad-lmi Kernel Module Could Be Exploited as a Backdoor

The thinkpad-lmi kernel module, which is part of the Linux kernel's platform support for Lenovo ThinkPads, interfaces with the firmware to expose certain low-level hardware features. Specifically, it allows for control over fan speeds, battery thresholds, and other system management features through the sysfs interface. While these features provide useful control over hardware, they can also introduce a potential attack surface when misused or left exposed.

1. Overview of ThinkPad-lmi Module

The thinkpad-lmi kernel module provides an interface for interacting with the ThinkPad's Embedded Controller (EC) or other system management components. It is designed to give the user control over various hardware functions that would typically only be accessible through firmware-level settings.

Some of the key features include:

Fan speed control

Battery charge thresholds

Power settings adjustments

BIOS version querying


The module exposes these settings through the /sys/class/ or /proc/acpi/ibm/ interface, which allows users or scripts to read and modify system-level information directly.

2. Potential for Backdoor Exploitation

The nature of the thinkpad-lmi module's access to low-level system components makes it a potentially attractive target for malicious actors if security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations exist. Here’s how it could theoretically be exploited as a backdoor:

a) Privilege Escalation via Sysfs Interface

The thinkpad-lmi module operates at the kernel level, and while it should only be accessible by root, misconfigurations in user permissions or sysfs exposure could allow unprivileged users to manipulate the system's behavior.

For example, if an attacker gains access to the sysfs interface, they could modify critical parameters like fan control, causing hardware damage, overheating, or even throttling performance. More dangerously, they could attempt to control power-related settings or modify BIOS-related configurations. Depending on the specific setup, it might be possible to disable certain security features or tamper with the boot process.

b) Malicious Kernel Module Injection

In systems where module loading is not tightly controlled, an attacker could potentially replace or modify the thinkpad-lmi module with a malicious version. A backdoored version of this module could hide its activities, intercept kernel calls, or provide attackers with covert control over hardware functions. Since the module interfaces with hardware management, an attacker could stealthily disable fans, tamper with power management, or even influence battery behavior to create more significant hardware issues.

c) Remote Access via Firmware Manipulation

Some configurations exposed by thinkpad-lmi could allow control over firmware updates or hardware settings, particularly if the ThinkPad's firmware allows remote management. A malicious actor with control over the kernel module might manipulate these settings to execute arbitrary firmware updates or exploit known vulnerabilities in Lenovo's embedded firmware. This could open up a remote access channel to the system, bypassing traditional software-based security controls like firewalls or antivirus tools.

d) Persistence Across Reboots

The fact that thinkpad-lmi interacts with system firmware means that it could be used to create persistence for a backdoor. By manipulating settings like BIOS boot order or Secure Boot settings, an attacker could create conditions where their malware or rootkit is reloaded on every boot. In addition, altering fan or power settings could allow the attacker to control when the system overheats or throttles, potentially avoiding detection by monitoring tools that don't expect such behavior.

3. Securing Against Exploitation

To mitigate the risks of thinkpad-lmi being exploited as a backdoor, several best practices should be followed:

a) Limit Access to Sysfs Interface

Ensure that only the root user or trusted processes have access to the sysfs interface exposed by the thinkpad-lmi module. This can be done by tightening file permissions and using tools like AppArmor or SELinux to enforce strict access controls on kernel modules and hardware interfaces.

b) Monitor Module Loading

Disable or restrict kernel module loading unless it is strictly necessary. If possible, use modprobe.d configurations to blacklist potentially dangerous or unnecessary modules. Furthermore, monitoring the integrity of modules like thinkpad-lmi should be part of a regular security audit to detect any unauthorized changes or tampering.

c) BIOS and Firmware Updates

Regularly update your ThinkPad's BIOS and firmware to patch known vulnerabilities that could be exploited through the thinkpad-lmi interface. Additionally, disable remote BIOS management unless explicitly needed, and always enforce BIOS passwords and Secure Boot features to prevent unauthorized modifications.

d) Kernel Hardening

Use kernel-level hardening techniques such as Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) and restrict direct memory access (DMA) from untrusted sources. Applying these security features can help mitigate the impact of any successful exploitation of thinkpad-lmi by making it harder to escalate privileges or maintain persistence in the system.

e) Monitor for Anomalies

Monitoring system logs for unexpected fan speed changes, power settings modifications, or BIOS update attempts could provide an early indication that something is amiss. Regularly audit access to the /sys/class/ or /proc/acpi/ibm/ directories to ensure no unauthorized processes are attempting to interact with low-level system management components.

4. Conclusion

While the thinkpad-lmi kernel module provides useful functionality for ThinkPad users, it also opens up a potential avenue for exploitation if not properly secured. By exposing hardware management features through the sysfs interface, attackers may find ways to escalate privileges, inject malicious code, or persist through reboots by manipulating firmware and BIOS settings. Therefore, it’s crucial to implement strong access controls, keep firmware updated, and monitor for unusual activity to reduce the risk of this module being used as a backdoor.

If you’re running Linux on a ThinkPad, it’s worth reviewing how the thinkpad-lmi module interacts with your system and applying appropriate security measures.

Looking for a tool to scan my Windows systems for vulnerabilities (CVE type). Network not connected to anything outside of the room it is in, so download and burn to disk all monthly updates.

I used the SCAP tool regularly to scan my systems. MITRE used to have a website that had OVAL files for all types of systems and updated it at least monthly. I could add that file to the SCAP scan and get my info, but they do not update that site anymore and need something new.

I have RHEL and Windows system (3 pc's and two server 2016).

Red Hat updates their oval files all the time, so have that covered but need something for my Windows systems.

Anyway, I am looking for recommendations on what to use to scan my windows systems for vulnerabilities.

,ComputerSecurity,"Hello Everyone, 

I'm a noob when it comes to cybersecurity. But I learned something about my apartment complex that has me worried about my internet privacy. 

So my apartment has bulk internet service for the entire complex. I have a couple ether net ports in the walls and a wifi access point, all provided and installed by the complex/isp. The apartment provided wifi and ethernet connections are all password protected (password and username are unique to my unit from what i can tell), but I am still worried about my traffic or ip being leaked. 

What ive done so far is connect my own combo wifi router to one of the ethernet ports and connected all of my devices to it. I also avoid using my wifi access point. 

Is this enough to keep people from breaking into my LAN and also enough to hide my traffic activity? If not, what can I do?

Also, can I get a lesson on how someone can look into my data, how they can break into my LAN, and how bulk internet is insecure?

,ComputerSecurity,"Hello,

Sorry for this question, but i am not techie enough to understand this:

Short version: Is it possible that an attacker can read data via wifi without beeing visible?

Long version:

Wifi traffic is secured using an encryption key (the WiFi password). So actually everybody can read the traffic with a capable device, but no clear data is readable, since its encrypted.

But when an attacker has the WiFi password, he could join the wifi network and read/decrypt the traffic.

BUT ... can an attacker also read the clear text data, without joining the wifi network? Maybe this imagination does not apply, but isn't the data not just 0s and 1s flying through the air?

Or is there some kind of extra ""salt"" coming from the router/access point and without joining it its not possible to decrypt it?

,ComputerSecurity,"**Incident Response Report: The Great Blue Screen Debacle**



Date: July 20, 2024

Incident: Widespread BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) Outbreak

Root Cause: CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor Update Gone Rogue



**Executive Summary:**

On this fateful day, our IT department inadvertently published a digitally \*optimized code\*. This later on caused chaos upon our unsuspecting workforce. What was supposed to be a routine CrowdStrike Falcon sensor update turned into a blue-tinted nightmare, leaving our employees staring helplessly at screens that resembled a clear summer sky - minus the sun, clouds, and any semblance of productivity.

Fortunately, we had the foresight to get an intern to do the publishing. He is now out of a job.

**Detailed Timeline:**

09:00 AM: IT team initiates the CrowdStrike Falcon sensor update, blissfully unaware of the impending doom.

09:05 AM: First reports of BSODs trickle in. IT team dismisses them as ""user error,"" because it's always easier to blame the users.

09:15 AM: BSODs multiply faster than rabbits in springtime. Panic ensues.

09:30 AM: IT team realizes this is not a drill. They frantically google ""how to undo a software update"" and ""nearest bunker locations.""

10:00 AM: Emergency response team assembled, consisting of three interns, a potted plant named Fred, and whoever could be bribed with promises of extra coffee.

11:00 AM: After numerous failed attempts and one inexplicable incident involving a stapler and a banana, the team successfully rolls back the update.

12:00 PM: Systems gradually return to normal. Employees emerge from their hiding spots, blinking in confusion at their now-functioning computers.

Root Cause Analysis:

The CrowdStrike Falcon sensor update, designed to protect our systems, apparently decided that the best defense was a good offense - against our own computers. It's like hiring a bodyguard who then proceeds to knock you unconscious for your own protection.



**Lessons Learned:**

1. Always test updates on a sacrificial computer first, preferably one belonging to that guy in accounting who keeps microwaving fish in the break room.

2. Keep a stack of board games in the office for emergency entertainment during extended outages.

3. Invest in stress balls and meditation apps for the IT team. They're going to need it.



**Preventive Measures:**

1. Implement a ""buddy system"" for software updates. One person to click the update button, another to hover over the ""undo"" button.

2. Develop a BSOD early warning system, possibly involving carrier pigeons or smoke signals.

3. Consider reverting to typewriters and abacuses for critical business functions.



**Conclusion:**

While this incident caused temporary disruption and a spike in blood pressure across the organization, we can all take solace in the fact that it provided an excellent team-building experience. Nothing brings people together quite like shared digital trauma.

Remember, in the immortal words of a wise IT sage: ""Have you tried turning it off and on again?""

**Evil Twin** is a method of masquerading the Access Point in order to confuse users into connecting to a malicious hotspot that appears to be legitimate. This type of attack is often used in Wi-Fi networks where the Evil Twin appears as a genuine access point with the same SSID and MAC address as a legitimate network. Once a user connects to the Evil Twin, the attacker can intercept sensitive data, such as login credentials and credit card information, or distribute malware to connected devices.

**Freeway's** role is automate the process of creating an AP, handle rerouting, configuring IP adresses, spoofing SSID, and MAC. Currently Freeway's **Evil Twin** should be compatible with most **Linux** distros, tested on: Kali Linux, KaliPi, ParrotOS.

I'd like to create a list of some security knowledge that would help typical computer users. Things like:

* Microsoft, Apple, and Dell will *never* call you about a security issue with your computer. If someone calls you and says they're from Microsoft, they're lying.
* If a message pops up saying your computer is infected, quit your browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.).  If the message goes away, it was fake.
* With nothing more than an envelope and a pen, you could send a letter, and instead of your own name and address in the upper-left corner, you could write someone else's name and address. It's equally easy to fake the ""from"" address on any email you receive.
* If you get an email with an attachment, *even* if the sender is someone you know, call them and ask if they really sent that email. Even if the subject is something totally innocent, like ""pictures from our vacation.""
* Don't click links in emails. If you get an email from your bank, your brokerage, etc., that says ""click here to update your account,"" don't click it.  Just open a browser window and type in the web address of that business.
* Your hard drive will stop working one day, and any files you haven't backed up will be lost.

Note: I'm trying to include stuff that's not obvious to average users, and that doesn't cost money.

I'm looking to set up a security solution at home similar to Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems typically used in enterprise environments. I want something that allows me to monitor my personal machines for suspicious activity, define custom rules, and receive alerts if anything potentially malicious is detected.

Does anyone know of any open-source or paid EDR-like solutions that are suitable for home use? Here's what I'm ideally looking for:

* **Rule-Based Alerts:** I want to be able to create or customize rules to detect suspicious behavior, such as unusual network traffic, high CPU usage, or unauthorized file changes.
* **Real-Time Monitoring:** The ability to monitor system activities in real time and get instant notifications when something looks off.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking to set up a security solution at home similar to Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems typically used in enterprise environments. I want something that allows me to monitor my personal machines for suspicious activity, define custom rules, and receive alerts if anything potentially malicious is detected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know of any open-source or paid EDR-like solutions that are suitable for home use? Here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m ideally looking for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule-Based Alerts:&lt;/strong&gt; I want to be able to create or customize rules to detect suspicious behavior, such as unusual network traffic, high CPU usage, or unauthorized file changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Time Monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; The ability to monitor system activities in real time and get instant notifications when something looks off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve had success with any specific products or tools, I&amp;#39;d love to hear about your experiences. Any recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

I live in Bangladesh and I am an individual human rights defender. I have a human rights website and do some level of human rights work.

Now, here in Bangladesh there has been ""rumored"" reports of human rights defenders, having their data wiped clean by some unknown actor. Some human rights defender kept a backup online, but someone used their password to delete the data. These data contained evidence of human rights violation.

Now, as an independent human rights defender working alone, one of the biggest challenges I am facing is keeping my human rights data safe.

Now I can create offline copies in pen drive and keep it in my country but that wouldnt keep the data safe and neither would any one be able to publish and continue the work.

There's an organization called SafeBox where journalists can send their data. They will keep the data saved offline and if something happens to the journalist will pick up from their work and continue the work. They do not accept data from human rights defenders

Hi everyone,
This is my first attempt in a flutter project!!! I used a concept I had in a project for university. Feedback will  be welcomed!!

It's practically impossible to keep track of all our passwords and account names.
The obvious alternative would be using only one password, which would lead to serious security problems.
The common solution to his problem is to use a password manager but even that raises concerns.
Most password managers require the usage of a database to store every password to facilitate usage. That leaves the users in an awkward position where they have to trust the service to keep their information safe and to inform them in case of a breach.
Our solution is a stateless password manager where we can generate random passwords in a replicable manner so they won't be stored in a database.
The user is asked for optional parameters like website, username and a master password, from which it will generate a replicable password secure and strong against most types of attacks.

This is my first attempt in a flutter project!!! I used a concept I had in a project for university. Feedback will  be welcomed!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s practically impossible to keep track of all our passwords and account names.

in germany there is a quiete new tool called ""hacktor"".It is bundeled in the software suite ""enginsight"" ([https://enginsight.com/en/pentesting/](https://enginsight.com/en/pentesting/)). It promises a kind of automatic pentest.

At first I thought, that it is a total ripoff. But after my testing I've come to the conclusion that it works amazing. It scans one or multiple IP-adresses and generates a reports which shows every open port and matches it with cve's (examples: [https://enginsight.com/wp-content/uploads/Enginsight-Audit-Zielansicht-1024x598.png](https://enginsight.com/wp-content/uploads/Enginsight-Audit-Zielansicht-1024x598.png) , [https://enginsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/auditreport\_warroom-1.jpg](https://enginsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/auditreport_warroom-1.jpg))

Hi, I've started using Google's Advanced Protection Program (I'll later call it APP) to secure my account with 2 YubiKeys, unfortunately enabling it broken F-Droid on my phone. I mean I cannot install any new app from F-Droid, I can only update apps that were installed before I enabled APP. As far as I read there is no option to disable this app installation blocking. BTW, Google in their help page claims that external app stores that were installed before enabling APP will not be affected, but supposedly Google doesn't recognize F-Droid as such. In my opinion being unable to turn this ""protection"" off is stupid and straight anti-consumer. If someone uses F-Droid it's their own decision, their own risk and their own responsibility to check whether what they installed is safe.

,ComputerSecurity,"I am writing this post there because there could be **people who have the same pain** in the neck with **database obfuscation**. I would love to see **any feedback about design and solution**. I got a few questions that would love to hear from you. If you wish to have a deep dive about it read the passage after the questionary.  
The questions to consider are:

* Is data **obfuscation** is hot topic in your experience?
* Do you see **value** in obfuscation tools and frameworks for data obfuscation?
* Should the development and research in this area **continue** in your opinion?

**Details are below:**  
**I have been working as a database administrator** for almost a decade and have spent a vast amount of time in database obfuscation while delivering safely anonymized dumps from production to the staging environments or providing it for analyzing purposes for analytics. And I was always struggling with a lack of technology in this area. That’s why I started to develop this project on my own using my experience with understanding the pros and cons of the current solution and developing something that would be extensible, reliable, and easily maintainable for the whole software lifecycle.  
**Mostly the obfuscation process was:**

* Build **complicated SQL** scripts and integrate them into a kind of service that is going to apply those queries and store the obfuscated data
* Confirm the obfuscation procedure with the **information security team**
* **Maintain the schema changes** during the whole software lifecycle

The main problem is each business has **domain-specific data** and you cannot just provide transformation for every purpose, you just can implement basic transformers and provide a comprehensive framework where users can design their obfuscation procedure. In other words obfuscation it’s also a kind of software development and it should be covered with all features that are used in ordinary development (CI/CD, security review, and so on).  
After all, I **collected** the things that would be **valuable** in this software:

* The only reliable schema dump must be performed by the **vendor utilities**
* Customization - possibility to **implement your transformer**
* Validation - possibility to **validate the schema** you are obfuscating
* Functional dependencies transformation - possibility to perform **transformation** when one column **value depends on another**
* Backward compatible and reliable - I want to have strictly the same schema and objects from production but without original valuable information

**And I started to develop** [Greenmask](https://github.com/GreenmaskIO/greenmask)**.**   
Greenmask is going to be a core of the obfuscation system. Currently, it is only working with **PostgreSQL** though a few other DBMS are on the way.

I'd like to highlight the key technological aspects that define Greenmask's design and engineering:

* Greenmask **delegates schema dumping** and restoration to pg\_dump and pg\_restore, while it handles table data dumping and transformation autonomously.
* Designed fo**r full compatibility with standard PostgreSQL utilities**. To achieve this, I undertook the task of porting a few essential libraries:
   * **COPY Format Parser**: While initially considering using the CSV format and the default Go parser, I encountered issues related to NULL value determination and parsing performance. Despite these challenges, this approach ensures nearly 100% compatibility with standard utilities, allowing you to effortlessly restore dumps using pg\_restore without any complications.
   * **TOC Library of PostgreSQL**: One of the primary challenges we faced in this project was the need for precise control over the restoration process. For instance, you might want to restore only a single table instead of an entire massive database. After extensive research, it became clear that using the pg\_dump/pg\_restore in directory format offered the best control. However, there was a gap in available Go implementations for this functionality.
* The core design philosophy **revolves around customization** because there is no one-size-fits-all solution suitable for every business domain. Greenmask empowers users to implement their own transformations, whether for individual columns or for multi-column transformations with functional dependencies.
* Greenmask transformers **offer multiple customization options**, including:
   * Implement your **custom transformer** (in Go or Python) with PIPE interaction using formats like JSON, CSV, or TEXT.
   * **Using templates**, which include pre-defined Go template functions and record template functions, enables you to create multi-column transformations in a way that resembles traditional imperative programming.
   * **Using CMD transformers**, allows you to interface your data with external programs written in any language and facilitate interaction via formats such as JSON, CSV, or TEXT.
* Greenmask has **integration with PostgreSQL driver (pgx)**. It was designed to make the tool powerful and customizable. In my point of view transformation is engineering work and for doing that you should use an appropriate tool set for doing whatever you want. Perform schema introspection and initialize table driver that could encode and decode raw column data properly
* Via data that was gathered during schema introspection, greenmask notifies you about **potential problems via warnings**. It verbosely says about potential constraint violation or other events for your awareness

This project started because of **experiences** and the fact that there weren't many tools available. It's being developed by a small group of people with limited resources, so your feedback is incredibly valuable. An early beta was released about a month ago, and getting ready to release a more polished version in mid-January. 

**If you're interested in this area**, you can check out the project and get started by visiting  [GitHub page](https://github.com/GreenmaskIO/greenmask).

How does Smart App Control work?

When you try to run an app on Windows, Smart App Control will check to see if our intelligent cloud-powered security service can make a confident prediction about its safety. If the service believes the app to be safe, Smart App Control will let it run. If the app is believed to be malicious or potentially unwanted, then Smart App Control will block it.

If the security service is unable to make a confident prediction about the app, then Smart App Control checks to see if the app has a valid signature. If the app has a valid signature, Smart App Control will let it run. If the app is unsigned, or the signature is invalid, Smart App Control will consider it untrusted and block it for your protection.

,ComputerSecurity,"I own a small business and I'm trying tomcome up with a secure way to login to the computers for the employees that is secure, but allows me access as I'm also the local IT guy.

Right now I have yubikeys setup.  Everyone has their own yubikey with a static 32 character randomly generated password that they don't know.  I realize they could find out but I'm not concerned with that.  I'm just looking for hacking protection really.  I've also got BitLocker set up in all comouters using 256-bit encryption.  A password is required on boot for BitLocker.  The password is 24 (or 20) characters that is also randomly generated.

I have a master list of everyone's yubikey passwords so that I can get into their profiles to do computer work/maintenance when needed.  I have an admin profile on all computers as well, but that doesn't allow me to fix issues with apps they might have problems with.

I'm not concerned about privacy because, well I own the computers, but as well, I can't get into emails because that is managed by my larger parent company via O365.

Is there anything that I can do that will allow me to use the yubikey Fido2 (or whatever it is) that allows for random rolling passwords?  But, still be able to login to their specific accounts to fix things?

,ComputerSecurity,"Hi folks,  
My team and I recently created, Retriever, an open source project that allows users to retrieve secrets between browsers securely and privately. We're sharing this here because we think a lot of folks would enjoy playing around with it.  
It allows anyone to securely request secrets 🔐 between browsers. This means no servers in the middle, no apps, and no sign ups. This open-source project uses public-private key encryption as a way to share data, and we've hosted on Github pages.  
Why did we do this?  
\- open source != open hosting  
\- data is still being sent and stored with a 3rd party. You have to trust they delete your data and other features they claim to have.  
\- URLs are not secure. if you get the secret url you have access to the secret.  
\- No other services have a way to request a secret from somebody. this tool helps you do that securely

,ComputerSecurity,"Hey everyone, not sure if this is the right sub for this question but I would love some advice. 

Over the past week, 4 times I’ve gotten text messages from Google with a verification code. It’s happening at random times in the day/night (in my time zone)

As soon as it happened the first time I logged in to my Google Account and changed my password. I didn’t see any other logged in devices, and I didn’t get any security notification emails. 

I’m feeling pretty confident that these texts are from Google since when I changed my password, the verification text came from the same number. 

I don’t think it’s something I’m doing since it’s happened at times that I’m not on my phone or laptop.

I was asked a scenario base question today during the interview and I believe I screwed.
What to know how you would have answered it.

,ComputerSecurity,"While people frequently mention cold-boot attacks, I have found shockingly little information on DMA attacks, and the information I have found tends to be fairly useless itself since many of the ways people talk about it are either incomplete, contradictory or focus on aspects which wouldn't affect an otherwise protected modern system. (there might be a more prevelant technical conversation around it, I'm just referring to what the average person can actually find with some educated googling) 

DMA, at least as I understand it, should represent an existential threat to computer security, it should have become a major discussion after things like thunderbolt were introduced widely onto consumer hardware but ***certainly*** now that usb 4.0 is similarly vulnerable and becoming a part of an open standard. (which *some* governing bodies have taken it upon themselves to begin legislating as mandatory. (I said *begin*, put down your ""um actually""-s) ) Despite this however, I've found very few recent mentions of it at all, and none (that I can remember) outside of explicitly tech/security focussed conversations that the majority of people would never see. I would understand radio silence if it was because these attacks were something extremely involved like a cold boot or extremely niche and didn't affect the vast majority of hardware or if it had been patched for a while now and most people weren't vulnerable anymore, but as far as I can tell none of that is true. 

While AMD and Intel have developed some mitigations, I've seen those mitigations as being mentioned as spoofable, (i.e. the device can lie about what it is to bypass them) thunderbolt specific, (i.e. they don't protect anything other than thunderbolt) incomplete, (i.e. it's still possible to perform a DMA attack) and poorly rolled out/supported. (i.e. : only fairly recent devices are protected and even many modern devices that could be and should be protected still aren't for one reason or another, be it that their BIOS wasn't updated to allow for it or because it just isn't enabled or whyever else) Unfortunately, I don't how how much, if any, of that is true or not since I feel like incomplete protections would be more frequently reported, but I also feel like this is something that should have had programmer asses in seats pulling overnighters to get it protected against a decade ago so I honestly have no idea. 

So, what is the actual state of DMA attacks currently? Let's assume the drive is already encrypted, the screen is already locked, (or it's in sleep or something similar so the key is in-memory but you can't send commands to it) it's running a completely updated stock linux kernel, (I don't think distro should matter here but if it does you're free to assume whichever one you want) and it's a recent device. So the data is secure if the machine crashes, you can't input any commands, it's got all of the OS patches it should have, and it was made in the last 3-4 years or so. (so it's hardware is from after windows adopted support for kDMAp and protections should, theoretically, have been in place for a while now) Let's also assume it's a desktop with free PCIe slots AND thunderbolt AND firewire, so every DMA avenue is theoretically avaliable ***and*** the user has not intentionally changed anything in the BIOS/UEFI. (and it does have a case lock but you have bolt cutters and a hammer because if you're doing a hardware attack and didn't think to prepare for hardware protections you're too dumb to even know what a DMA attack is in the first place) 

So, given a recent, well secured machine that has ports which would (in theory) be DMA vulnerable, what is the actual state of DMA attacks in the present day? Are the modern protections good enough and prevelant enough to be taken as granted, or are even fairly modern machines still vulnerable?

,ComputerSecurity,"**AMD security revelation 5 years ago. I never heard about it. Was this real? What finally happened? What was the resolution of this?**

 **From the excellent site** [**Security Week**](https://www.securityweek.com/security-firm-under-fire-over-disclosure-amd-chip-flaws/)**:**

AMD is  investigating claims that its processors are affected by more than a  dozen serious vulnerabilities, and the company that found the flaws is  facing backlash over its disclosure method

Israel-based CTS Labs on Tuesday published a report claiming that it has found[ 13 critical vulnerabilities and backdoors](https://www.securityweek.com/researchers-find-critical-security-flaws-amd-chips/)  in AMD’s EPYC, Ryzen, Ryzen Pro, and Ryzen Mobile processors over the  course of six months. Only a high level description of the security  holes has been made public, but AMD was informed of the flaws only one  day before disclosure. 

**The vulnerabilities** 

CTS Labs has set up a dedicated [website](https://www.amdflaws.com/)  and assigned names to each type of vulnerability it has found.  According to the company, the security holes mostly affect AMD’s Secure  Processor technology and they can be exploited for arbitrary code  execution, bypassing security features, stealing data, helping malware  become resilient against security products, and damaging hardware.

The vulnerability class dubbed MASTERKEY by CTS Labs  can reportedly be exploited to deploy persistent malware inside the AMD  Secure Processor, but exploitation involves installing a malicious BIOS  update. These flaws can be used to bypass firmware and software security  features, including the Firmware Trusted Platform Module (FTPM), Secure  Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), Windows Defender Credential Guard, and  Microsoft’s Virtualization-based Security (VBS) technologies. MASTERKEY  can be leveraged to steal network credentials and cause physical damage  to targeted devices, CTS said. 

The RYZENFALL vulnerabilities, which affect Ryzen  processors from AMD, in the worst case scenario, can be exploited to  take complete control of the Secure Processor. Attackers can leverage  this to plant malware that cannot be removed by traditional security  solutions, researchers said. 

FALLOUT vulnerabilities affect the boot loader  component of the Secure Processor in EPYC CPUs. Exploitation requires a  digitally-signed driver supplied by the vendor. Attackers can leverage  FALLOUT to plant highly persistent malware, disable BIOS protections,  steal network credentials, and bypass security mechanisms. 

The last class of vulnerabilities has been dubbed  CHIMERA. These are backdoors in AMD’s Promontory chipsets, which are  used in Ryzen and Ryzen Pro workstations. The backdoors, found in both  the firmware and the hardware, can be exploited to execute malicious  code inside the chipset’s internal processor, CTS said. These backdoors  were reportedly introduced by ASUS subsidiary ASMedia.

Exploitation of all the vulnerabilities requires elevated privileges to the targeted machine. 

**Impact and comparison to Meltdown/Spectre** 

Security firm enSilo, which published an [FAQ](https://www.ensilo.com/faq/chimera-ryzenfall-fallout-masterkey/) shortly after CTS Labs made available its report, compared the vulnerabilities to [Meltdown and Spectre](https://www.securityweek.com/search/google/meltdown%20and%20spectre?query=meltdown%20and%20spectre&amp;cx=016540353864684098383%3A6mcx-eenlzi&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;sitesearch=&amp;safe=off), which impact CPUs from Intel, AMD, ARM and others. However, some argued that the issues disclosed by CTS Labs are [nowhere near as severe ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/844o3c/amd_security_flaw_found_in_ryzen_epyc_chips/)due to the fact that they mostly impact AMD’s Secure Processor technology rather than the hardware itself. 

[Dan Guido](https://twitter.com/dguido/status/973629551606681600?s=21),  CEO of Trail of Bits, said his company reviewed CTS Labs’ technical  report and confirmed that the vulnerabilities exist and that the  proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits work, but admitted that all flaws  require administrator privileges for exploitation. Trail of Bits was  paid by CTS Labs to review the findings. 

Researcher [Arrigo Triulzi‏](https://twitter.com/cynicalsecurity/status/973591954096381952) called CTS’s report “over-hyped beyond belief” and a “whitepaper worthy of an [ICO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering).”  Triulzi‏ pointed out that if an attacker obtains elevated privileges  and is able to perform malicious BIOS updates and load unauthorized  code, they would not need to exploit these vulnerabilities in order to  gain complete control over a system. 

Triulzi‏ admitted that the CHIMERA vulnerability  could pose a problem, but only “if you are a government agency.” CTS  noted in its report that it may not be possible to directly fix this  bug, and it may require a workaround or a recall of the product. 

**Controversial disclosure** 

AMD was only given one day to prepare for CTS Labs’  disclosure and the company says it has launched an investigation.  Vendors are typically given months to fix or mitigate these types of  flaws; in the case of Meltdown and Spectre, affected companies were  given roughly half a year to work on patches. 

“This company was previously unknown to AMD and we  find it unusual for a security firm to publish its research to the press  without providing a reasonable amount of time for the company to  investigate and address its findings,” [AMD stated](http://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/view-our-corner-street-0). 

While CTS Labs has not released any details and  claims no technical information will be made available any time soon to  prevent abuse, its methods have been called into question. 

“The way that CTS Labs chose to publicly identify  vulnerabilities they discovered in AMD chips is a case study in what not  to do when you discover a software or hardware weakness in the wild,”  Jon Bottarini, Technical Program Manager at HackerOne, told  SecurityWeek. “Responsible disclosure should be the prime directive for  security researchers, and by only allowing AMD 24 hours to respond  before CTS Labs notified the press, CTS stood to do more harm than  good.” 

Many potentially serious [vulnerabilities](https://www.securityweek.com/intel-chip-flaws-expose-millions-devices-attacks/)  have been found in similar Intel technologies over the past year, but  in most cases they were responsibly disclosed to Intel and the company  started working on patches before disclosure. 

On the other hand, CTS’s unorthodox disclosure method may have been driven by financial motives. 

“Although we have a good faith belief in our analysis  and believe it to be objective and unbiased, you are advised that we  may have, either directly or indirectly, an economic interest in the  performance of the securities of the companies whose products are the  subject of our reports,” CTS Labs noted in its [report](https://safefirmware.com/amdflaws_whitepaper.pdf). 

A [controversial company ](https://www.moneyweb.co.za/in-depth/investigations/viceroy-unmasked/)named Viceroy Research published its own report following CTS Labs’ disclosure in an apparent effort to short AMD stock. 

“In light of CTS’s discoveries, the meteoric rise of  AMD’s stock price now appears to be totally unjustified and entirely  unsustainable. We believe AMD is worth $0.00 and will have no choice but  to file for Chapter 11 (Bankruptcy) in order to effectively deal with  the repercussions of recent discoveries,” [Viceroy Research said](https://viceroyresearch.org/2018/03/13/amd-the-obituary/). 

In addition to the findings, some have [called into question](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/845xks/some_background_information_on_the_new_amd/)  the credibility of CTB Labs, a company founded in 2017, and its  founders’ claims regarding other firms they launched and worked for. 

This would not be the first time a report describing  vulnerabilities in a product is used as part of an investment strategy.  In 2016, investment research firm Muddy Waters used a report from  medical cybersecurity firm MedSec to [short-sell St. Jude Medical](https://www.securityweek.com/security-firm-discloses-medical-device-flaws-part-investment-strategy/).

I never heard about it. Was this real? What finally happened? What was the resolution of this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the excellent site&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.securityweek.com/security-firm-under-fire-over-disclosure-amd-chip-flaws/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMD is  investigating claims that its processors are affected by more than a  dozen serious vulnerabilities, and the company that found the flaws is  facing backlash over its disclosure method&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel-based CTS Labs on Tuesday published a report claiming that it has found&lt;a href=""https://www.securityweek.com/researchers-find-critical-security-flaws-amd-chips/""&gt; 13 critical vulnerabilities and backdoors&lt;/a&gt;  in AMD’s EPYC, Ryzen, Ryzen Pro, and Ryzen Mobile processors over the  course of six months. Only a high level description of the security  holes has been made public, but AMD was informed of the flaws only one  day before disclosure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CTS Labs has set up a dedicated &lt;a href=""https://www.amdflaws.com/""&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;  and assigned names to each type of vulnerability it has found.  According to the company, the security holes mostly affect AMD’s Secure  Processor technology and they can be exploited for arbitrary code  execution, bypassing security features, stealing data, helping malware  become resilient against security products, and damaging hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability class dubbed MASTERKEY by CTS Labs  can reportedly be exploited to deploy persistent malware inside the AMD  Secure Processor, but exploitation involves installing a malicious BIOS  update. These flaws can be used to bypass firmware and software security  features, including the Firmware Trusted Platform Module (FTPM), Secure  Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), Windows Defender Credential Guard, and  Microsoft’s Virtualization-based Security (VBS) technologies. MASTERKEY  can be leveraged to steal network credentials and cause physical damage  to targeted devices, CTS said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RYZENFALL vulnerabilities, which affect Ryzen  processors from AMD, in the worst case scenario, can be exploited to  take complete control of the Secure Processor. Attackers can leverage  this to plant malware that cannot be removed by traditional security  solutions, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FALLOUT vulnerabilities affect the boot loader  component of the Secure Processor in EPYC CPUs. Exploitation requires a  digitally-signed driver supplied by the vendor. Attackers can leverage  FALLOUT to plant highly persistent malware, disable BIOS protections,  steal network credentials, and bypass security mechanisms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last class of vulnerabilities has been dubbed  CHIMERA. These are backdoors in AMD’s Promontory chipsets, which are  used in Ryzen and Ryzen Pro workstations. The backdoors, found in both  the firmware and the hardware, can be exploited to execute malicious  code inside the chipset’s internal processor, CTS said. These backdoors  were reportedly introduced by ASUS subsidiary ASMedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploitation of all the vulnerabilities requires elevated privileges to the targeted machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact and comparison to Meltdown/Spectre&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security firm enSilo, which published an &lt;a href=""https://www.ensilo.com/faq/chimera-ryzenfall-fallout-masterkey/""&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; shortly after CTS Labs made available its report, compared the vulnerabilities to &lt;a href=""https://www.securityweek.com/search/google/meltdown%20and%20spectre?query=meltdown%20and%20spectre&amp;amp;cx=016540353864684098383%3A6mcx-eenlzi&amp;amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;amp;sitesearch=&amp;amp;safe=off""&gt;Meltdown and Spectre&lt;/a&gt;, which impact CPUs from Intel, AMD, ARM and others. However, some argued that the issues disclosed by CTS Labs are &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/844o3c/amd_security_flaw_found_in_ryzen_epyc_chips/""&gt;nowhere near as severe &lt;/a&gt;due to the fact that they mostly impact AMD’s Secure Processor technology rather than the hardware itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/dguido/status/973629551606681600?s=21""&gt;Dan Guido&lt;/a&gt;,  CEO of Trail of Bits, said his company reviewed CTS Labs’ technical  report and confirmed that the vulnerabilities exist and that the  proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits work, but admitted that all flaws  require administrator privileges for exploitation. Trail of Bits was  paid by CTS Labs to review the findings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researcher &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/cynicalsecurity/status/973591954096381952""&gt;Arrigo Triulzi‏&lt;/a&gt; called CTS’s report “over-hyped beyond belief” and a “whitepaper worthy of an &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering""&gt;ICO&lt;/a&gt;.”  Triulzi‏ pointed out that if an attacker obtains elevated privileges  and is able to perform malicious BIOS updates and load unauthorized  code, they would not need to exploit these vulnerabilities in order to  gain complete control over a system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Triulzi‏ admitted that the CHIMERA vulnerability  could pose a problem, but only “if you are a government agency.” CTS  noted in its report that it may not be possible to directly fix this  bug, and it may require a workaround or a recall of the product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controversial disclosure&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMD was only given one day to prepare for CTS Labs’  disclosure and the company says it has launched an investigation.  Vendors are typically given months to fix or mitigate these types of  flaws; in the case of Meltdown and Spectre, affected companies were  given roughly half a year to work on patches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This company was previously unknown to AMD and we  find it unusual for a security firm to publish its research to the press  without providing a reasonable amount of time for the company to  investigate and address its findings,” &lt;a href=""http://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/view-our-corner-street-0""&gt;AMD stated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While CTS Labs has not released any details and  claims no technical information will be made available any time soon to  prevent abuse, its methods have been called into question. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The way that CTS Labs chose to publicly identify  vulnerabilities they discovered in AMD chips is a case study in what not  to do when you discover a software or hardware weakness in the wild,”  Jon Bottarini, Technical Program Manager at HackerOne, told  SecurityWeek. “Responsible disclosure should be the prime directive for  security researchers, and by only allowing AMD 24 hours to respond  before CTS Labs notified the press, CTS stood to do more harm than  good.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many potentially serious &lt;a href=""https://www.securityweek.com/intel-chip-flaws-expose-millions-devices-attacks/""&gt;vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;  have been found in similar Intel technologies over the past year, but  in most cases they were responsibly disclosed to Intel and the company  started working on patches before disclosure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, CTS’s unorthodox disclosure method may have been driven by financial motives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Although we have a good faith belief in our analysis  and believe it to be objective and unbiased, you are advised that we  may have, either directly or indirectly, an economic interest in the  performance of the securities of the companies whose products are the  subject of our reports,” CTS Labs noted in its &lt;a href=""https://safefirmware.com/amdflaws_whitepaper.pdf""&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Sadly I do not have much free time to configure and set up a new standalone router, hence I have to connect to built in router of ONT for now.

In the past, I used an XP computer to control an instrument that collected data and it was necessary to use the XP computer. The XP computer was not allowed on the network, I believe due to no longer being supported. The lab had a workaround where a 2nd computer was used. Based on my understanding, the 2nd computer was on the network and had a 2nd network card that connected to the XP machine. I was able to remote desktop into the 2nd computer, and from there was then able to remote desktop into the XP machine. This allowed me to control the instrument remotely.

According to [this stack exchange question](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/71/how-can-i-generate-large-prime-numbers-for-rsa?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1),  the best way is using a combination of [Fermat and Miller-Rabin](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/691200/Primality-test-algorithms-Prime-test-The-fastest-w) tests, each done multiple times.

Fermat:     a^(n-1) mod n = 1

The problem is, using Fermat's test, the faster of the two, and using the simplest and smallest number a = 2, I can't come remotely close to testing a prime in the needed range, atleast 10\^150.

My computer can't even calculate n=10\^20, as you need to take a^(10\^20 - 1),  and I don't have enough memory for that.

What can i do??  Even the simplest version of the simplest test would take billions of times the memory I have, not even counting the run time.

It's obviously possible, but I can't find anything anywhere on how!",t2_2wxvbx34,False,,0,False,Generating large prime numbers,[],r/ComputerSecurity,False,6,,0,,False,t3_124tejf,False,dark,0.83,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,False,False,,1680027249.0,,[],{},,True,,1680018988.0,text,6,,,text,self.ComputerSecurity,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(EDIT: Solved!

,ComputerSecurity,"Hi there,

Our website got a phishing attack that's almost 4 weeks ago and the web developer has already cleaned up and done some security patches. updated the software and close all loopholes for uploading pages etc.

We found 1 entry on MXToolbox and we removed it 3 weeks ago.

We still have an issue with the URL on email due to content filtering and so we started digging further into this and this is related to content filtering. It turned out that the content filter providers/endpoint security providers have a common that they maintain their own database which has detection date, web classification (before and after) and expiry date.

Then we found  VirusTotal which aggregate of the endpoint security providers that can see the status of the URL against each provider. Last week, we found 12/92 phishing/malicious found and today down to 3/92 found.  Some we have to report manually to do the false positive and some seem automatic.

My questions are:

* If we are NOT reporting this manually to do a false positive, will each system lift the ban after the expiry date (my assumption is 4 weeks in this case) - back to normal?
* I  know the reclassification of the website to phishing/malware back to normal can be up to 4 weeks. Is 4 weeks the maximum penalty?
* Are there any other tools like VirusTotal and MXToolbox out here that do a similar thing?

At the moment, we have submitted the ""false positive"" as much as we can, and now just wait and see.

I'm appreciated your feedback.

What I am looking for a piece of software that would, at the miniumum, discourage people from accessing typical PC functions, such as a web browser, email, chat apps, and from altering any of the system files without my consent.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caveat is, if it&amp;#39;s a piece of software, it cannot overburden the computer&amp;#39;s resources, as I need as much of  the power as possible to run virtual reality applications. I am not an IT person or programmer by trade, so the simpler the solution, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I greatly apprecaite it, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

Hi all,

Hope you’re all OK!

Specially, after COVID19 and all the fuss about cybersecurity and the  use of a VPN as a lever for security. Several security breaches have been noticed: unauthorized access to clients data and many other.

Among this conventional cyber-attacks, the risks of using VPN is more challenging. Besides malware on the computer, there are issues like DNS leaks.

She grew up under the watchful eyes of DevDad and the day came for Appy to move beyond the perimeter of DevDad’s safe SandCastle. But Appy was scared. She worried she would encounter Badhats while sailing the Wild Wild Web.\n\nAs Appy couldn’t help people while stuck in the SandCastle, DevDad needed to prepare her for the world. In order to do so, DevDad spun up a container ship just for her. The container ship would contain all of the resources for Appy to provide her services to the outside world.\n\n[Container Ship](https://imgur.com/uAtrnLU)\n\nBut not all clients can be trusted, and some are downright malicious. Appy's DevParents worried if Appy would be abused — or worse — so DevDad asked if she remembered her stranger danger lessons on zero trust. \n\n“Is that the thing the vendors keep trying to sell to you?” Appy asked.\n\n“Yes,” DevDad nodded, “But remember: you can never *buy* zero trust. Zero trust is how you do things, like counting the change before leaving the store. Trust nothing, verify everything.”\n\n“But what’s it for?” Appy seemed confused. “Is there something wrong with how I do things?”\n\n“It’s for keeping yourself safe. Sometimes we do things because it’s simple, or because it's fast. In certain cases, we do it because we've always done it that way. For example: Remember when I always tell you to look before you jump? Why did you trust that where you jumped would be an easy or safe landing?”\n\n[Trust](https://imgur.com/qXbudNV)\n\nAppy thought about what DevDad meant. “But what if I’ve safely made that jump many times and know there’s pillows at the bottom?”\n\nDevDad nodded. “I understand. But then, what if the next time you jump without looking, someone else had come and taken all the pillows? Then you’d be hurt, because you trusted what you **knew to be true, but is no longer true**. That’s why you should check and verify each time. Do you know what we call this?”\n\n“Um, um,” Appy snapped her fingers, “Continuous verification!”\n\n“Yes, but remember: that’s just one part of zero trust.”\n\n“Can you buy continuous verification?” Appy asked.\n\nDevDad paused. “I suppose you can buy tools that do continuous verification,” he agreed. “But that alone does not give you zero trust. Remember, you *cannot* buy zero trust. But you should always be checking whether you are safe, and whether the tools and process you depend on to keep you safe are working. Like your container ship! Come check it with me.”\n\n[Containers](https://imgur.com/Qpp2To3)\n\n“OK,” Appy eagerly looked inside her container ship. It was snug and contained everything she would need to sail the Wild Wild Web, maybe even a temporary deployment to the Castle in the Clouds or Edge of the World. “But how do I know who to talk to and who to let into my container ship? How do I make sure I’m not hurt by baddies?”\n\n“Once you’re out there it become important for you to understand when to say no, but more importantly, **how to enforce your decisions**.” DevDad began installing something into Apply’s container ship. “This is a reverse proxy for controlling who gets to touch your container ship, and it will help carry out your decisions. You tell it the rules you want for checking who can touch your ship and what they can do. Do you remember the three things you should be checking?”\n\n[Trust Algorithm](https://imgur.com/kazrYtO)\n\n“Yes!” Appy replied. “Who they are, what they’re using, and um, what they’re trying to do!”\n\n“Very good. User, Device, and Request Context, which all make up the Access Request for your container ship.” DevDad smiled encouragingly, “And remember, you must continuously check if what you think you know is true. Don’t trust what you knew, but what you can currently verify. This continuous verification process is how you ensure you can trust something to be safe.”\n\n“So the goal is to trust?” asked Appy. “But doesn’t that defeat zero trust?”\n\n“Zero trust doesn’t mean **no** trust, just means that your trust for anything *starts* at zero. When you practice zero trust, your trust must not only be earned, but *continuously* earned.” DevDad replied. “So let me check that you understood this. You trust me, right?” \n\n“I do!” Appy burbled happily. “You had a hand in creating me.”\n\n“And sometimes I might want to come see you again once you leave SandCastle.” DevDad hoisted Appy into her container ship. “But no matter how excited you are to see a familiar face, how do you know it’s me?”\n\n[Peeking](https://imgur.com/18jD7pk)\n\nAppy peeked outside of her container ship. “I can’t just look at you?”\n\n“No, because then you would forget to do User Authentication.” DevDad summoned up an exact replica of himself, then the two walked around Appy’s container. “Sometimes, Badhats like to pretend they’re someone you know in order to get you to open your container for them. They might look and sound like me, but you must make sure to have multiple methods of checking to make sure if it *is* me.”\n\n“Like the phrase we use?”\n\n“Exactly! But what if Badhats heard us use the phrase or force me to reveal our phrase? Another thing you can check is whether I’m carrying something you know only I have, such as these.” DevDad pulled out a set of keys from his pocket. Nearby, the clone reached into his pocket and pulled out nothing, for it did not have the same set of keys. “User Authentication is an important thing to verify, or you end up letting someone in because you believe they are someone they are not.”\n\n[Verifying](https://imgur.com/fMntz36)\n\n“Won’t people hate me for asking them to prove they are who they are?” Appy frowned. “I would hate to be asked to prove who *I* am.”\n\n“Oh of course,” DevDad agreed, “People hate it. But that’s why I set up your reverse proxy to do all that checking for you as quickly as possible…as long as you remember to check! Now, do you remember the second thing to verify?”\n\n“Um, what they’re using!”\n\nDevDad summoned up another ship and stepped into it. “Correct. Do you know why?”\n\nAppy thought hard. “Because sometimes what they’re using to connect to my container might be dangerous?”\n\nDevDad’s ship rolled up to bump against Appy’s container. “Sometimes, you might confirm the person who’s trying to talk to you is real. But how do you know they’re not being forced to trick you? Or how do you know their ship isn’t carrying anything dangerous?” DevDad’s ship container opened to try and connect with Appy’s ship. “For example, you’re allergic to all manners of insects — how do you know my ship is bug-free? Just because I said I cleaned it?”\n\n“But I can’t go onto your ship to check.” Appy pointed out.\n\n“No, you can’t. But your reverse proxy can ask my ship’s trusted platform module (TPM) whether my ship is as clean as it should be. Only after you have proof that my ship is safe to connect with should you allow the connection.”\n\n[TPM](https://imgur.com/k90aOO6)\n\n“Finally, the Request Context. As you said, it’s checking what they’re trying to do. If you open your container ship for someone to come fix a leak in the front, but they want to go straight to the back and look around your room, does that make sense? No! So whenever they want to do something, you need to check that it makes sense to allow them to do that.”\n\nDevDad stepped off his container ship and it disappeared, but Appy seemed deep in thought.\n\n“This is a lot to check before I let someone do anything,” Appy observed from inside her container ship.\n\n“Indeed it is.” DevDad agreed. “To make it simple for you and your guests, I have configured your reverse proxy to do all of that. But remember, you —”\n\n“— can’t buy zero trust. I can only check that I am still practicing zero trust.” Appy intoned.\n\n“Correct!” DevDad knocked on Appy’s container, “Now come on out. l have one last thing to show you.”\n\n“Nuh uh. Can you prove who you are?”\n\n[Verify](https://imgur.com/ZwmD09F)\n\nDevDad smiled, seeing that Appy was learning. He authenticated himself with a phrase and key to Appy’s container and showed that it was just him for his ship was gone. “As for what I want to do — I believe you’ll need help deploying your container ship to the Wild Wild Web.”\n\nAppy came out of her container ship to hug DevDad. “Does this mean I’ll be sailing alone?”\n\n“You’re a grown app now, you’re free to go where you’re needed whether it’s the Castle in the Clouds or the Edge of the World.” DevDad returned the hug. “I’ll come find you every once in a while, but remember —”\n\n“Zero trust, and to always check if I’m doing it.”\n\n[Castle in the Clouds](https://imgur.com/j7k5ElI)\n\nTogether, DevDad and Appy pushed her container out to the Wild Wild Web.

,ComputerSecurity,"Hello fellow redditors,

I recently got a windows tablet and would like to know my options to secure it and my personal data. I estimate i have a fairly good chance of having the device stolen or losing it at some point and would like your advice on :

1. ensuring the tablet and it's data are not physically accessed by unauthorized people. I would guess this is probably in the realm of encryption solutions
2. enabling backup solutions. In case of lost or theft, i would want to be able to recover my original surface system and files from a cloud. Ideally just download a cloned version of my original one

I've looked into a few options like iCloud Personal, Acronis, Backblaze etc... but thought i would ask here first.

Any suggestion is welcome on a good combo of softwares or a software that would fit both needs.

,ComputerSecurity,"I'm changing my name and moving from the US to the UK. That means new documents, new email, and new phone number. I've got a chance to start fresh with my entire online presence.

My account security plan is as follows:

* 1Password for password management.
* All my logins other than 1Password and Google will have randomly generated passwords and TOTP tokens (when possible) stored within 1Password.
* 1Password and Google will share a memorized password and use shared Yubikeys (1 on my keyring, 1 at home, 1 in a safe deposit box) for 2FA.
* 1Password recovery plan
    * I'll store my 1Password secret key in Google Drive as a 7zip encrypted file using the same password as 1Password and Google. 
    * In the catastrophic event that I lose all devices logged into 1Password, I'll need to log in to Google and download/decrypt the 1Password secret key.
* tl;dr: Maintain 1Password and Google with the same password/Yubikeys. Use Google Drive to recover encrypted 1Password secret key in an emergency.

My identity plan:

* Sign up for IdentityForce UltraSecure+Credit to monitor for identity theft.
* I've purchased a domain for my email (first@last.tld). Since Gmail doesn't support custom domains, I'll use SMTP via a different provider. My domain registrar and email provider accounts will be secured with my 3 Yubikeys to prevent domain hijacking.

My internet safety plan:

* I'm considering Google's Advanced Protection Program. Thoughts?
* Malwarebytes Premium
* Browser Extensions:
    * Ublock Origin
    * Malwarebytes Premium
* ProtonVPN

Network Security plan:

* Pi-Hole with DNS Over HTTPS
* Complex Wi-Fi passwords for all networks
* Separate guest network with convenient QR code for sharing
* Separate IoT network

Potential points of failure:

* Using the same password for both 1Password and Google. 
    * I know this isn't ideal, but I have a long, complex password that I really like and will never forget. Since I'm also using hardware security keys, I feel like the risk is minimal.
* Losing access to all devices logged into 1Password AND Google AND losing ALL 3 Yubikeys.
    * This seems unlikely, especially when storing a Yubikey in a safe deposit box.

Questions:

* I'd love to hear about Google's Advanced Protection Program from any users. Can I install Reddit Enhancement Suite? If I have it installed before I activate APP, will it be removed? If I get a new PC, will I be able to re-install RES even if it isn't an approved extension?
* Any experience with using a Yubikey for Windows login? What's the process like?

&lt;li&gt;In the catastrophic event that I lose all devices logged into 1Password, I&amp;#39;ll need to log in to Google and download/decrypt the 1Password secret key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tl;dr: Maintain 1Password and Google with the same password/Yubikeys. Use Google Drive to recover encrypted 1Password secret key in an emergency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My identity plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up for IdentityForce UltraSecure+Credit to monitor for identity theft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;ve purchased a domain for my email (&lt;a href=""mailto:first@last.tld""&gt;first@last.tld&lt;/a&gt;). Since Gmail doesn&amp;#39;t support custom domains, I&amp;#39;ll use SMTP via a different provider. My domain registrar and email provider accounts will be secured with my 3 Yubikeys to prevent domain hijacking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My internet safety plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m considering Google&amp;#39;s Advanced Protection Program. Thoughts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Malwarebytes Premium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser Extensions:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ublock Origin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Malwarebytes Premium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ProtonVPN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network Security plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pi-Hole with DNS Over HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex Wi-Fi passwords for all networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate guest network with convenient QR code for sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate IoT network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential points of failure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the same password for both 1Password and Google. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know this isn&amp;#39;t ideal, but I have a long, complex password that I really like and will never forget. Since I&amp;#39;m also using hardware security keys, I feel like the risk is minimal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Losing access to all devices logged into 1Password AND Google AND losing ALL 3 Yubikeys.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This seems unlikely, especially when storing a Yubikey in a safe deposit box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to hear about Google&amp;#39;s Advanced Protection Program from any users. Can I install Reddit Enhancement Suite? If I have it installed before I activate APP, will it be removed? If I get a new PC, will I be able to re-install RES even if it isn&amp;#39;t an approved extension?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any experience with using a Yubikey for Windows login? What&amp;#39;s the process like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything I&amp;#39;m missing? Anything I&amp;#39;m wrong about? Please tell me! Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

,ComputerSecurity,"Hey guys!

I'm currently trying to setup full disk encryption on Windows 10 with using my FIDO2 device as a key. 

I've done this in Linux with LUKS2 using `systemd-cryptenroll --fido2-device`, and I'm wondering if there is a way of getting a similar functionality in Windows 10.

I'm currently using VeraCrypt, but afaik it only supports decryption using passwords and keyfiles (and even then, you can't use keyfiles for system encryption). Aloaha apparently supports system decryption using keyfiles/certificates as keys, but not using FIDO2 as a key. I don't think BitLocker supports FIDO2 either but you can get software/libraries to emulate a FIDO2 device as a keycard, but that involves entering the pin for the FIDO2 device which I would want to avoid (like passing `--fido2-with-client-pin=no` to `systemd-cryptenroll`). 

Any advice is welcome, and thank you in advance!

From the OP
""I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit to ask this question or not, but I need to get access to the data partition of a device to analyze its contents. The device is a Skylight picture frame running an RK3128 with an unknown Android OS (locked down, guessing version 5?). I'm interested in inspecting the device because it's happened to either pick up or was shipped with a nasty addon from China. I'm not sure how ""common"" this sort of business is from a picture frame, I know there was a thing with insecure picture frames before but this is my first actual find.

Basically, this picture frame seems to be monitoring network traffic of any user-connected network. It then reports randomly sized encrypted payloads back to several different adups servers on every initial connect and on a random schedule thereafter. This wouldn't really be that suspicious, except that it's scanning for and attempting to connect to any Wifi network with a weak password and an Internet connection in the background. It will connect to any SSID using any number of dumb/weak passwords, I'm guessing from an internal table. If it doesn't get an Internet connection within 30 seconds, it moves on to the next network. All the while, the Android UI just insists that there's no network connection possible although it can see networks (likely because something in the background has stolen the radio). Additionally, it scans and connects to any insecure Bluetooth devices nearby, but I don't have a way to intercept its communications currently. I suspect the BT component could be used for wiretapping, though the range is abysmal because a circuit trace is the antenna.

Skylight support immediately played quiet when asked how to access their device to assess the malware and ""are talking to our senior developers to figure out a fix"". The ""senior developers"" (I'm sure in China) also denied any possibility of getting inside the storage of this. I'm suspicious that they may have knowingly shipped this with malware, or added it after the fact and I would like to prove it. I split the frame open since I was pretty sure it would just be a generic board like a Pi inside, possibly with serial pads or other development options. However, I don't know what I'm looking at or if it will meet my goals. There are OTG-DP and OTG-DM pads next to the Micro-USB port, a USB-A port, a 5v barrel connector and a large number of unmarked pads around what appears to be an expansion ribbon connector spot.

,ComputerSecurity,"I'm considering buying an external SSD to have work software/files and some personal documents on the go but the big concern is that in case of a theft I want to be sure that no one can access what's on the drive (I don't mind if the CIA does, but I want to be sure that some everyday-thief won't be able to run some identity-theft scheme)

My big pre-req is that I don't have admin rights on some of the machines I'll be using the drive so the decrypt/mounting software can't require these.

Linux compatibility would be nice but I'll live without (there is always a windows machine on the same network)

- VeraCrypt seems a no-go, if I don't have bad informations the (portable) mounting software requires admin?
- BitLocker seems to work? Can some confirm that unlocking a drive doesn't require admin rights?
- Is there anything worth looking into in the Samsung T7 Touch (or similar) gear with fingerprint scanner? Or is it just another useless gimmick?

,ComputerSecurity,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I have wanted to be able to connect to my desktop remotely for a long time. I want to be able to be wherever (AKA I don't know what my IP will be on my client) and to be able to connect to my desktop (which I have available to web via DDNS).  I'm not the best with networking, but I thought a way I could do this safely would be to set up XRDP connections through SSH. I think I have this working properly, but a requirement of this is still to allow SSH connection attempts from the open world.

&amp;#x200B;

I have configured my sshd to only accept key authentications (by setting `sshd_config` to have `PubkeyAuthentication yes` and `PasswordAuthentication no`), but obviously people could still try to initiate an SSH connection if they knew my URL.

&amp;#x200B;

I will also probably choose a random port to have my router port forward to 22, so that anything just probing 22 would miss, they would have to discover the port first.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there an easier way than this to feel safe about what I'm trying to do? Slash is it possible to really feel completely safe at all as long as my computer has any ports open  to the wild wild web? I feel like I'm doing some common sense ""security"" by obfuscation, ""don't be the lowest hanging fruit"" kind of stuff, but still nervous someone might get in here and keylog me and get all my goodies.

,ComputerSecurity,"I am setting up a private web-server, for professional work use, for customers, colleges etc.

I also need an SSL certificate to run encrypted SSL, and I would like to explore the possibility of really certifying that this site is truly connected to me (and not to an imposter) by purchasing an Extended Validation (EV) certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA). 

""EV"" means the CA will go to great(!) length to really verify that I am the physical person I claim to be, before them. It's kindof like opening a bank account. So an EV SSL can really be trusted as belonging to whoever it says it belongs to, verified by a CA.

An EV certificate also means that the information about the certificate owner (me) will appear close to the padlock icon in the visitor's web browser, a so called green icon, and the certificate will of course hold my name in it plus some additional data about me. this is thought to act as authentication that it is me and my server.  

Now, I have made a principle thing over the years, to keep any information about myself away from the internet, search engines and whatever it might be. And been successful at it too. And I am now concerned that search engines and robots might be able to pick up-, register-, and cache my name (and other data about me) from the SSL certificate itself?

If so, searching for my name on search engines might reveals that my name is somehow connected to the site I'm using the EV certificate on.This is something I really wouldn't want. It's a weird issue, trying to remain incognito, yet still authorized at the same time. I know :)

I'm having problems finding information about however searchbots ans search-engines can pick up- and register details from the SSL certificate used for a public web resource? Even the CA support service gave answers to this question that were .. hazy :)

,ComputerSecurity,"Any Java application may be concerned by a hacker attack using a type narrowing leak. If a program does the following things in this order among others:

1. Assert that a numerical id is allowed
2. Do a type narrowing among other things, even followed by a type widening
3. Do an action with the numerical id

...the hacker can do disallowed actions. Let's say that a given user doesn't have rights to change an amount for the id `63`:

    public void changeAmount(long userId, double newAmount) throws IllegalArgumentException {
      isUserIdAllowedOrThrowException(userId); // userId = 4294967359
      ...
      int theUserId = (int) userId; // theUserId = 63
      ...
      userId = theUserId; // userId = 63
      ...
      doChangeAmount(userId, newAmount); // userId = 63
    }

It will fail passing `63` but it will success passing `4294967359` because `4_294_967_359` is narrowed into `63`. Let's call `4_294_967_359`  a rebound of `63`. `4294967359` can be retrieved in few seconds by a basic program like this:

    public class MyClass {
      public static void main(String args[]) {
        long targettedNumber = 63;
        for (long rebound = Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1; true; rebound++) {
          int typeNarrowing = (int) rebound;
          long typeWidening = typeNarrowing;
          if (typeWidening == targettedNumber) {
            System.out.println(""Rebound for "" + targettedNumber + "" found: "" + rebound);         return;
          }
        }
      }
    }

And it can be optimized like this:  `(1L &lt;&lt; Integer.SIZE) + 63`. It works for any type narrowing. It not only works for numerical id but also for flags. If a numerical value should contain or not several flags, you can search a rebound among billions of rebounds until you find one with the perfect features. All the Java versions are concerned. The security layer can even be coded in another programming language.

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will fail passing &lt;code&gt;63&lt;/code&gt; but it will success passing &lt;code&gt;4294967359&lt;/code&gt; because &lt;code&gt;4_294_967_359&lt;/code&gt; is narrowed into &lt;code&gt;63&lt;/code&gt;. Let&amp;#39;s call &lt;code&gt;4_294_967_359&lt;/code&gt;  a rebound of &lt;code&gt;63&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;4294967359&lt;/code&gt; can be retrieved in few seconds by a basic program like this:&lt;/p&gt;

,ComputerSecurity,"Hello CS,

Question I was looking over my junk email and I noticed I got an email from FB security team notifying me that someone was or had logged into my fb from another location using another device I didn’t recognize. I checked the email handle and it came from facebookmail.com which google says is an email that facebook uses. The thing being is the facebook account was supposed to be deleted as I’m trying to defacebook myself. I tried logging back in but got an invalid user and ID, this makes sense as the recovery time for a deleted facebook has passed. I checked my password on the facebook account in my bitwarden and it’s a 30 character randomized by bitwarden and it had 2fa enabled when I requested that fb delete it, the delete recovery time expired more than 4 months ago. I did a recover password using the email that I received the alert too. It pulled up a facebook account. The spelling of the name on the account matched the spelling of my name in the email salutations as it had an oddly placed special character in the name. I had them recover the password but they asked me to verify another email that I didn’t recognize that had an AOL handle on it. I’m trying to determine if someone just put my email into their account as a recovery or if the old account wasn’t deleted properly. I’m pretty good about using 2fa on my bitwarden and using randomly generated passwords for all my social media. Also all the social media is locked down with only friends or family on it to prevent scrapping.

&lt;p&gt;Question I was looking over my junk email and I noticed I got an email from FB security team notifying me that someone was or had logged into my fb from another location using another device I didn’t recognize. I checked the email handle and it came from facebookmail.com which google says is an email that facebook uses. The thing being is the facebook account was supposed to be deleted as I’m trying to defacebook myself. I tried logging back in but got an invalid user and ID, this makes sense as the recovery time for a deleted facebook has passed. I checked my password on the facebook account in my bitwarden and it’s a 30 character randomized by bitwarden and it had 2fa enabled when I requested that fb delete it, the delete recovery time expired more than 4 months ago. I did a recover password using the email that I received the alert too. It pulled up a facebook account. The spelling of the name on the account matched the spelling of my name in the email salutations as it had an oddly placed special character in the name. I had them recover the password but they asked me to verify another email that I didn’t recognize that had an AOL handle on it. I’m trying to determine if someone just put my email into their account as a recovery or if the old account wasn’t deleted properly. I’m pretty good about using 2fa on my bitwarden and using randomly generated passwords for all my social media. Also all the social media is locked down with only friends or family on it to prevent scrapping. I also reviewed my old junk emails and found just 1 other email from facebookmail.com saying someone else tried to log into my facebook. I also avoid using public wifi without a vpn. Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also my email has 2fa enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, on other OSs, I&amp;#39;ve just typed Printer Settings (Kali doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have something like this) into the menu and &amp;#39;add a printer&amp;#39; and done it that way. Is it really secure to enter your actual system password into a browser???&lt;/p&gt;

this was the only one I could sort of regenerate, and 

I tried this on w3 php try it editor and it didn't work, tried running it on a php compiler, it returned a webpage (an HTML FILE) and when I rendered that file it showed me this screen, which left me fascinated and crapping my pants because,  

while this did not work on the w3 site,

Are HMAC challenge/response tokens still a thing ?  Can they be used in situations where there is no network or server ?  Such as BIOS login when booting.

Can one have multiple HMAC challenge/response tokens that are identical, so if you lose one you can choose to just continue using the others without having to change anything on your accounts ?

Do any online accounts use HMAC challenge/response tokens ?  I'd like to use same token both for my BIOS login and for my email login, for example.

Is there some alternative hardware token standard that I'm overlooking ?

Is that correct ?  So you couldn&amp;#39;t use it to do BIOS login while booting your laptop, or to do disk decryption before OS login and network up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are HMAC challenge/response tokens still a thing ?  Can they be used in situations where there is no network or server ?  Such as BIOS login when booting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can one have multiple HMAC challenge/response tokens that are identical, so if you lose one you can choose to just continue using the others without having to change anything on your accounts ?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a product designer who is currently designing the platform on which I will design products. That is to say, the infrastructure, software, storage, etc. for all things digital (descriptions of ideas, drawings, CAD files, etc.) which I will utilize.

I'd prefer to stay within the Google/Drive/Gmail/Sheets/Docs infrastructure as it's good, reliable, cheap, convenient, available from anywhere/any device and always backed up to the cloud.

What if I accidentally leave my account logged in somewhere? Or my account is hacked? Or there's a Google data breach? It could jeopardize my entire portfolio of products still in development.

As such, does anyone have recommendations for what platforms/software to use for such things? Am I overthinking it with the risks of using Google? Are there ways to lock down the account and make it more secure without sacrificing so much convenience as to make it untenable? More strict account settings? Encryption integration? Etc?

&lt;p&gt;I am asking this question because I want to know have I actually made my Linux install more secure by taking implementing this step or is this a waste of time ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using Linux Mint 20 at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

I know a decent amount about CS but I’m far from an expert. I do however follow as many best practices as possible when it comes to security online. I have 2FA enabled on every account where it’s available and use Dashlane password manager with zero duplicate passwords for accounts as well as dark web monitoring and password/account alerts in case a site gets hacked. 

This morning I woke up to 3 unauthorized purchases on Amazon for a little under $1000 USD total. The purchases were made from my Amazon account which unfortunately won’t let me not store my payment methods. I have no notifications that the password was changed by anyone nor compromised in any way. The Account has 2FA and is not set to remember any device/browser so I have to type it in each time and the code is generated every 30 seconds using Authy. 

Can someone please shed light on to how it is possible that somebody was able to get my account details as well as the one time code needed to access my account?

- I could buy a cheap android phone, and regenerate 2FA QR codes on all sites that I use them, and setup both my primary iPhone and backup Android authenticator apps to have the OTP's available

,ComputerSecurity," Hi everyone. For context: I'm a sysadmin with a decent understanding of offensive hacking, and I run a few LAMP servers on DigitalOcean for personal niche websites and a few clients' websites. A couple months ago I put all my domains on a bug bounty (openbugbounty org) to help me identify weaknesses as I continue growing. (I've had only minor exploits mentioned, and most of the researchers violate the rules I wrote, ie. dont attack subdomains, don't report self-xss, etc ). Since this started, I would occasionally see my MYSQL server drop, maybe twice a month. I would reboot my server and all would be well (in retrospect I see how dumb this attitude was). I've also begun getting a TON of log traffic, as one would expect.

Here's where I make a huge embarrassing mistake; I decided to use my main production server to host the development environment for a new version of a CMS I wrote in PHP/MySQL. I was working on dev(.)mysite(.)com, which was on the same server as mysite(.)com, and used the same MySQL server. I really can't explain my thinking on this one. At my 9-5 I'm very strict about having the developers keep dev and production environments separate, so this is out of character for me. I guess my level of security-consciousness is proportional to the amount of explaining I'll have to do.

About a week or ago I find my CMS won't allow me to login. I checked the DB and there are hundreds and hundreds of new entries in the *users* table. Interestingly, the user account I was trying to login with looked untouched. I obviously got caught slipping with a SQLi vulnerability. No other tables were affected that I know of, as this CMS uses an un-privileged DB account. I shut the dev site down, and moved it to a local LAMP server on my home network. Better late than never. Now I'm trying to figure out what happened, and how far the breach went.

I have over 1,000 log files in /var/log/apache2, and most other directories in /var/log/ are also packed to the gills. There's too much noise (presumably) from the bug bounty for me to analyze anything. I spent a day writing python scripts to analyze stuff. I have one that compiles all website-specific logs into respective master files, and runs scalp.py on them, outputting everything to an HTML file I can navigate. There's so many random injection attempts that the script is almost useless to me. I wrote another script to analyze the /var/log/auth.log file and at least count and sort the types of messages. The output can be found [https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx](https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx) . Sorry if the output is confusing, I don’t understand what a lot of the messages mean, so just did a basic count for now.

I only saw on single SSH login that I didn't recognize, and it was on the account smmsp. This also lead me to see in my mail log files that somebody had found an old forum install I forgot about, and had been using it to send massive amounts of spam emails to email addresses in Russia. I've removed the account, the forum, and uninstalled sendmail.

I'm at the point of the investigation where I risk going down the wrong path and wasting valuable time.

So here’s my questions:

1. Are there any programs that will do an in-depth audit of my logs? I did a bunch of searching, but almost nothing fits the bill besides scalp.py, and that’s only for website-specific log files. I’m more than happy to expand my own scripts to do this if I need to, but would request someone push me in the direction of the information I need to start studying.
2. Is there an application that could blacklist an IP address if it recognizes injection attempts? I’m sure a WAF could pull something like this off, but have never used any so I would be swinging in the dark by picking one. I can write a script to do it too, using the logs to identify IPs, but is there a specific method of blacklisting that I should be leaning towards if I need to do this on my own?

,ComputerSecurity,"Hi everyone.

I noticed banks are increasing the blocking of anonymizer VPN providers to deter fraud. When connecting from a VPN, the bank may block the login attempt, prompt the login process with a security question/answer, or in some more extreme cases, disable or close the account requiring the affected user to go into a branch to verify their identity with bank staff. 

I understand why this is occurring with the increased fraud. However, my question is, what are the back-end providers banks are using to monitor for, detect, and prevent log-on from VPN providers?

Google research suggests several banks and financial providers use a company called Maxmind ([https://www.maxmind.com/en/home](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home)).

,ComputerSecurity,"My email was leaked, so of course I started getting massive amounts of spam. I also got a new type of spam: subscription spam, which is where bots sign you up for 100s of newsletters that don't have captchas or anything. Newsletters are much less likely to be auto marked as spam so they often go straight to inbox.

Anyway that email address nearly unusable until I spent a bunch of time cleaning it up. This got me wishing I could've just dumped the email address and moved on (I couldn't do that since it was tied to too many things).  Imagine if I could have just updated the email address on 1 website- problem solved. That also helps security, I think-- if someone steals one of your email accounts, the worst they can do is log into 1 company.

The main problem I can see with this approach is that it is kind of difficult to maintain dozens of email addresses. I'm pretty sure Google auto deletes gmail accounts after 1-2 years of you not logging in. So you'd need to manually log into each email address occasionally. Also if you are talking to customer service and they ask you for your email address, you might not be able to remember unless you follow an obvious naming convention.

Newsletters are much less likely to be auto marked as spam so they often go straight to inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway that email address nearly unusable until I spent a bunch of time cleaning it up. This got me wishing I could&amp;#39;ve just dumped the email address and moved on (I couldn&amp;#39;t do that since it was tied to too many things).  Imagine if I could have just updated the email address on 1 website- problem solved. That also helps security, I think-- if someone steals one of your email accounts, the worst they can do is log into 1 company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem I can see with this approach is that it is kind of difficult to maintain dozens of email addresses. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure Google auto deletes gmail accounts after 1-2 years of you not logging in. So you&amp;#39;d need to manually log into each email address occasionally. Also if you are talking to customer service and they ask you for your email address, you might not be able to remember unless you follow an obvious naming convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Is there a better way?&lt;/p&gt;

,ComputerSecurity,"(Note this is an edit, to hopefully better explain what I was talking about here).

Phishing is very common, and not only that, very easy to detect.   Someone sends you an email that attempts to get you to click a link that will send you to a site that looks like the login screen for a popular site like Ebay, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.

What I have never seen discussed very often at all in the last 40 years or talked about is another possible security flaw.   What if someone purposely sets up a real website.   Key word is real.   Not a phish, not a fake, not a copy of a popular site.   Instead they set up a real site and this site is run by a hacker or a group of hackers.

A  hacker could use this trick:  They create a legitimate website.   Say a  computer gaming website.   They require people to create an account to  access the website, where people have to enter an email and a password.    They delete or edit the password file, so that people trying to login,  will see, your password is incorrect and get a message ""try again"".     So someone trying to login to the legitimate website, will ""cycle thru  all their passwords"".

A possible ""real"" scenario of someone trying this:    For example, if you want to hack into Steam accounts, this is how I would do it:   1st) Get a list of upcoming planned to be released games on Steam,  2nd) Check for a soon to be released game where there are no fan websites yet,   3rd) Create a fan website for the upcoming to be released game  (prior to the games release date),    4th) Make sure you require people to create an account to use your fan site, 5th) Now after the game is released, people buy it and may search for information on how to play the game, and they will go to your site and type in an email and password to create their account, 6th) You as the hacker and site administrator, do what I suggested in the paragraph prior to this one.

This is just an example scenario.   The security flaw, is that phishing is VERY easy to detect, but how would you know if your favorite site  (think of any site you visit every day), is actually being run by a hacker or group of hackers?     Maybe when you go to search for information on the game that you just purchased, that site is being run by a hacker.

Phishing is very easily detectable.   But how would you detect if it is actually a real site?   How would you know that this real site is being run by a hacker or group of hackers?

I tried posting this to Google /r/techsupport as I lost my phone and therefore lost access to my account. Instead of helping me, they banned me for ""promoting using less secure passwords"". Typical of Google. Oh well.

Icomera, a leading provider has the following sign up scheme.

Sign up with email address.
Verify email link.

Sign in as anybody else 😂.

The fact they are verifying email links implies they want to be sure who users of their systems are.

This is worrying because if I sign in with a targets email address and get up to shit, especially with Mac address spoofing then my actions get pinned on the target.

This assumes the target has registered with icomera.

Not the wisest idea.

Hi Guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently put together a really cheap and yet massively powerful PC. I bought all parts from other sources.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately my PC is not perfect, motherboard has two USB ports that do not work, two 3.0 USB ports and two 2.0 ports are displayed. There are also half a dozen 1.1 USB ports that actually exist and a few that don't. At first I thought of CPU, which might be crazy \[there are actually wrong temperature values ​​for two sensors\], but my research did not reveal anything that explains this additional USB.

&amp;#x200B;

Could it be that the person who sold me the motherboard sold me a motherboard prepared with malicious hardware? It is conceivable that a kind of '' Bad USB '' can be integrated into a USB socket. There is enough space in it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone dealt with something like this, or does someone know their stuff? Am I worrying too much?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!",t2_b9ud5nj7,False,,0,False,alicious hardware [Bad USB] integrated in USB socket?,[],r/ComputerSecurity,False,6,,0,,False,t3_o32ovc,False,dark,0.69,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1624057635.0,text,6,,,text,self.ComputerSecurity,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

It goes something like this:

* Encryption/decryption is handled by cryptsetup with the veracrypt extension
* Starting the hidden os is done by booting a usb drive with another esp and /boot installed to it, which is assumed to be kept safe.

&lt;ul&gt;

My main PC is the main concern which I would like to keep completely isolated from any other networked devices, but I'd like to be able to connect other things, possibly through a 2nd router/access point.

,ComputerSecurity," Hi,

Hope you're doing well.

Here are two articles critical of Linux in general and Linux phones:

[https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux-phones.html](https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux-phones.html)

[https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html](https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html)

I wonder if any of you delved in either and have a take on what is stated??

&amp;#x200B;

Some points on the Linux article:

\- Sandboxing

\-  memory unsafe languages such as C or C++, as opposed to Rust

\- code reuse attacks like ROP or JOP

\- loading a malicious library on disk or by dynamically modifying executable code in memory

\- uninitialized memory

\- Kernel lacking in security

\- abundance of ways for an attacker to retrieve the sudo password

and I quote the author: ""The hardening required for a reasonably secure Linux distribution is far greater than people assume. You will need full system MAC policies, full verified boot (not just the kernel but the entire base system), a strong sandboxing architecture, a hardened kernel, widespread use of modern exploit mitigations and plenty more"".

Some points on the Linux phones article:

\- All the previous points about Linux apply

\- Apparently gyroscopes and accelerometers can be used to get audio, he supplied two articles. I plan to read them fully as I'm interested in learning how this is possible. I wonder if it's still in an academic stage though. Has anyone heard of this?

\- His argument against the network kill switch

I hope that you contribute and that you contribute **objectively into the points.**

From what I've read if people have access to my PC, they can steal my browser cookies and then hijack the login to my email, if I stay login into the email account.

Let say my RAM is corrupted of a sudden, I cannot log in to Windows and I don't have a chance to clear my cookies, whether using browser settings or CC Cleaner. Then I have my laptop sent to a repair shop for a replacement, the technician will also ask for my Windows password. This made me worry if he trolls my online accounts or even worse if he copies the cookies files into his computer.

I use a password manager for most accounts, but not for email accounts. I prefer to use my memory for my emails, just in case something happened to the password manager vault. So, it will be a hassle to change my email password and then memorize a new password later on.

\- I already spent time Googling here and there with keywords like ""does cookie store passwords"", ""what to do before sending computer to repair"". So, I already know the basics.

\- I already know how to delete cookies, history, cache, etc.

\- I use Cookie Auto Delete browser extension on Firefox and Brave browsers, but I whitelisted cookies from certain websites including my Gmail account, Tutanota Mail account, Reddit.

\- I encrypted some of my files with Cryptomator. But I cannot encrypt the cookie files which are located at C:\\Users\\Your User Name\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles.

,ComputerSecurity," Hello wonderful users of reddit,

I'm taking a cybercrime module on my Masters, and I love it. My lecturer is a memey legend, and it's super interesting. But I'm basically the Jen of IT crowd, and come from a neuroscience background, so I understand computers as much as I understand... idk, obscure philosophy or smth. This cybercrime module has people from my criminology MSc course, but also from another engineering course, with many computer science/engineering grads. You can imagine the dichotomy. I realised my lack of knowledge when I quickly got lost in the tutorial today, despite spending HOURS OF MY LIFE doing reading prep. A lot of my coursemates from my course want to drop out, but I am determined to persevere and TO LEARN GODDAMNIT but I need your help reddit

See, I asked a couple of questions but they got completely ignored (press F) because, I think, people just thought they were really stupid questions (accurate). I spent most of the lesson frantically googling terms like MFA and VM that my coursemates were dropping.

Fast forward to the past few days where I'm trying to catch up on everything I don't know about wtf the internet is etc. And now I pose my questions to the reddit community so I don't embarrass myself further in front of my course mates, PLEASE HELP ME BECOME A NERD

1. I think I get what a VPN is, but can it help guard against malware like an antivirus or firewall can?
2. Why exactly do people need zombie networks etc when launching large scale attacks? I think it has something to do with bandwidth but idk exactly what bandwidth is rip
3. What's the most effective way of guarding against malware cyberattacks? This is asked a lot in the tutorial to prompt a debate but all my tech-savvy zoom buddies replied using abbreviated terms so I don't actually know the answer

There’s so many routes to take and it’s been a little difficult to decide which schools to even look at. I’m also thinking about having some leniency to explore the field also. Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time it took me hijacking a managers phone number and resetting their bank password in front of them for them to get the message. (I had his permission of course)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if any of you have articles, videos, demos, anything I can show an educated layman as irrefutable proof its a bad idea, please link them here.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm staying in a hotel room and needed to buy a small, cheap laser printer for some printouts I need to do.

Anyway, perhaps this is all nuts. Perhaps a lowly printer literally can't do anything. But maybe it can (installing stuff- oh man, the drivers I just realized, or maybe saving info I'm sending to print, etc.) I'm no expert in this so wanted to check here.

There were also several (progressively less secure) layers of using it I wasn't sure about:

1. Simplest was going to be straight USB connection.
2. They also allow you to connect to it as a wireless hotspot to print (as opposed to it connecting to a local network for all devices to print). I guess at that point it has no internet connection so no worries?
3. There is some mobile app you can get to allow you to print from a mobile device. I assumed this was the least secure.

,ComputerSecurity,So basically I currently leave my PC at my father's house and leave for a week at a time. I left once and returned to see an account under his email after booting up my system. If I try to login to it it pops up with a windows login screen which I think is for a live account of sorts. Now it's important to state now that I don't trust my father at all and he knows what he is doing on computers (he has a degree in computer science) and I need to see what he's doing on my system. I've previously deleted this email account and its now back which means only he has booted up my PC and added it back.

,ComputerSecurity,"In your opinion: what would be best practice for security on your computer:

1. A host os (Linux or Windows) just with my files and Virtual-Machine-Software. Each application runs in its own VM. Most VMs are rolled back to initial Snapshots after work. Needed files are routed into VM.
2. A baremetal linux hardened with tools like SELinux, Apparmor etc.

* Pros on option 1: Softwaresettings are safed in the VM so that my VMs run like expected on every machine. Also moving to a new computer or factory-reseting the computer is simpler. No need to configure anything. Also each application is in its own sandbox, so you can control what files it sees, if its connected to the internet. You can use snapshots. Convinient for rolling back malware or settings
* Negs on option 1: Much more diskspace is occupied. Backups are more complex or last longer. Sometimes there are flaws in the VM-Software like VMware. This slows working down. 
* Pros on option 2: You use the whole hardware of your computer and dont have to assign RAM and CPU Cores to different vms and limit each application. More power-efficient.

* Rational: In my opinion option 1 would be more secure because of the compartmentalization and simple when moving or resetting the machine. But you use 100x more Diskspace, limit the hardware. 
* Emotional: Option 2 feels lighter and faster. Even if powering up a vm-snapshot only last 10 seconds longer then opening firefox directly, this feels huge. But i also feel less secure on option 2 because every application has internet connection, has access to all files. And hardening all this might be more complicated then set up vms.

Currently i am using option 1 with windows as host os. Next step would be to cut the host os from the internet. But this means using a vm with wsus-Server to get updates for windows. Other option would be to use linux as host os.
But often it feels just burdening and slowing down my work. Especially if i just want to look up something, or just look for mails.

,ComputerSecurity,"Hi,

I just did some brainstorming and came up with a fun side project. I want to do some kind of unique password-manager. My idea is to randomly generate passwords using some kind of master key, instead of encrypting passwords and storing them somewhere.

Let's say I have a function that generates a 'random' password using a seed. It's important that the function will always generate the exact same password for a given seed.

    def generate_pw(seed):

Now my idea is to save some id's like this permanently. For each Account, you'd add a new ID.

    ids = ('steam', 'ts3', 'insta')

When starting the password manager the user is prompted to enter the master key. The program will then 'randomly' generate all the passwords by concatinating each id with the master key and using the result string as the seed. 

So if the master key is '123', it would generate a password for the id 'steam' with the seed 'steam123'. Also, it would always show the same passwords without storing them on the hard drive. I can only think of brute-forcing all possible master keys to calculate the passwords. But how is the brute-force-algorithm supposed to tell the right passwords apart from false ones, generated with a wrong master key? They all look like 'randomly' generated strings. So as long as the intruder has none of the correct passwords I can't think of a way to easily hack this system. But I feel like there is a reason why there are no systems that work like this, am I missing something?

&lt;p&gt;So if the master key is &amp;#39;123&amp;#39;, it would generate a password for the id &amp;#39;steam&amp;#39; with the seed &amp;#39;steam123&amp;#39;. Also, it would always show the same passwords without storing them on the hard drive. I can only think of brute-forcing all possible master keys to calculate the passwords. But how is the brute-force-algorithm supposed to tell the right passwords apart from false ones, generated with a wrong master key? They all look like &amp;#39;randomly&amp;#39; generated strings. So as long as the intruder has none of the correct passwords I can&amp;#39;t think of a way to easily hack this system. But I feel like there is a reason why there are no systems that work like this, am I missing something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

So I told them a breach of my privacy, and security doesn’t matter to you? They literally said nothing we can do.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a few on edx, coursera and udemy, but a suggestion on where to start would be welcomed. I don&amp;#39;t mind wheter to study on Windows or Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

,ComputerSecurity,"Hi all,

Just like title.

A few days ago an ID thief went to one of the stores of my cell phone provider.  An employee of the store bypassed the security protocols, and the One Time Password text message that was supposed to be required to change anything on my account(I actually got another store employee to show me the internal computer records of the cell phone companies computer system and let me take photos of the data logs showing that an employee manually bypassed the password/account pin security requests).  The ID thief activated a different cell phone with my cell phone number.  They then used that device to request a password reset and my hotmail account was supposed to be secured by my cell phone, but the attacker had my cell phone(well, a different cell phone that now had my cell phone number and was able to get the text message to reset my password.  The ID Thief/attacker then changed my hotmail password and locked me out of the account and enabled 2FA on my hotmail account (they had control from about 40 minutes before I caught on to what was happening and got it shut off but I was too late).

I have already created a new email account, changed all of my passwords, frozen my credit files, contacted local and state police as well as several other state and federal law enforcement agencies as well as some attorneys to figure out what I can do from a legal standpoint, but the email that was stolen was my primary email address for many years and I had lots of highly sensitive information in this email account. (I'm also dealing with the financial implications since the attacker has been trying to get into my financial accounts but that's a different story)

The email account was also tied to my laptop, so now I don't know how to do a system wipe/restore of my laptop (I have an hp laptop that came with windows 10 as part of the purchase) because my microsoft account was tied to my hotmail account all together and now I don't have control of my microsoft account anymore.  

I did the microsoft password reset attempt form but it says 
""It looks like you just used the Microsoft account recovery form (https://account.live.com/acsr?mkt=en-US) to request a password reset for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Because you've turned on two-step verification for your account, we ignore these requests but wanted to let you know.
""

so if they ignore password reset requests for accounts with 2FA how can I recover my microsoft account? It's not only tied to my hotmail but my windows installation.  I don't know how to do a system restore and tie my laptop login to a new email. I want to wipe my laptop and just reinstall windows and I also want control of the hotmail account again, I don't plan on using it for anything ever again, I just want to make sure the attacker/another id thief can't use it to do more damage to my identity/finances etc.

My scans seem to still be completing and the virus definitions are updating, but there is a flag both on AVG and on Windows security.

,ComputerSecurity,"I work for a company with shall we say a very, very limited security budget (made even worse with COVID-19). Some of the basic network/security tools you'd want we do not have yet, although I have been asking and presenting ROI reports and such repeatedly. 

The current conundrum I am trying to work through is how to safely perform security investigations with the tools I have. Two investigations of high concern that I handle on a regular basis are malicious emails and potential malware (all types).  

The main issue I currently have is we do not have a sandbox environment nor does my issued laptop have the capability of running a decent VM in order to segregate any type of malicious items during an investigation.   
Again I have submitted a request for a laptop upgrade, as well as valid reasoning with needs aligned with my position in the company and position expectations, this was done roughly Dec 2019. Given the current financial hardship many businesses are facing (my organization is no exception) I fully anticipate my request will continue to be post-poned for the foreseeable future. With that in mind I have been trying to think of outside the box options that would be more cost efficient. One idea I have had which I would like some input on is a partitioned persistent USB drive. I am not sure if it would work or if it is a bad idea ergo my request for input. 

The idea would be to partition an external hard drive/USB (if I had my choice i would go with something like 128 GB SSD USB) with part of the USB being set up as a persistent USB with Windows 10 Enterprise to match our PCs (although a case could be made for KL)  the other part would be memory to store the investigation files that would grant access to the persistent USB side, as I can safely download the reported emails and their attachments as well as any reported malware software/programs. Interested in thoughts and opinions, also if you have any other ideas, again I am trying to limit exposure as much as possible, so me downloading the emails on my laptop and opening them, or me downloading potentially malicious programs to investigate is what I am trying to avoid.",t2_2myhx05p,False,,0,False,Interested in a few opinions - security risk mitigation,[],r/ComputerSecurity,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gs8969,False,dark,0.92,,public,10,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,10,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1590679452.0,text,6,,,text,self.ComputerSecurity,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work for a company with shall we say a very, very limited security budget (made even worse with COVID-19).

&lt;p&gt;The current conundrum I am trying to work through is how to safely perform security investigations with the tools I have. Two investigations of high concern that I handle on a regular basis are malicious emails and potential malware (all types).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main issue I currently have is we do not have a sandbox environment nor does my issued laptop have the capability of running a decent VM in order to segregate any type of malicious items during an investigation.&lt;br/&gt;
Again I have submitted a request for a laptop upgrade, as well as valid reasoning with needs aligned with my position in the company and position expectations, this was done roughly Dec 2019. Given the current financial hardship many businesses are facing (my organization is no exception) I fully anticipate my request will continue to be post-poned for the foreseeable future. With that in mind I have been trying to think of outside the box options that would be more cost efficient. One idea I have had which I would like some input on is a partitioned persistent USB drive. I am not sure if it would work or if it is a bad idea ergo my request for input. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea would be to partition an external hard drive/USB (if I had my choice i would go with something like 128 GB SSD USB) with part of the USB being set up as a persistent USB with Windows 10 Enterprise to match our PCs (although a case could be made for KL)  the other part would be memory to store the investigation files that would grant access to the persistent USB side, as I can safely download the reported emails and their attachments as well as any reported malware software/programs. Interested in thoughts and opinions, also if you have any other ideas, again I am trying to limit exposure as much as possible, so me downloading the emails on my laptop and opening them, or me downloading potentially malicious programs to investigate is what I am trying to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

""This is to all of my network security friends. It appears as though my mom's computer might have been infected with a virus. A little background is that my mom had to get a new keyboard since she spilled tea on her old one. The new one was a wireless keyboard and mouse from Microsoft. When they set it up and went online, the keyboard would randomly type either a ""S"", ""U"", or ""F"". When I went up to check on it, it was typing out something along the lines of ""ssssuuuuuuuuuuuuuuffffffff suf suf sufffff"". I immediately unplugged the ethernet cord and it stopped. I went into the apps for Windows 10 and saw a few things have been downloaded in the past few days such as ""windows-office-en-update"" that didn't have the publisher of Microsoft. I uninstalled that and it did in fact remove all of Office with it. I also had programs like ""McAfee Antivirus"" (who uses that?) and ""McAfee SafeConnect"". I was able to remove the antivirus but the safeconnect will not uninstall. All it did was remove the shortcut but the program file is still installed. I even tried doing it as an administrator. After uninstalling these suspicious programs, I plugged the ethernet back in. I use the xFi pods for the ethernet connection. The xFi pod went offline and I tried adding it back on and it won't register. So I got a new pod and also used an old wired keyboard and mouse. The same thing started happening as well as pulling up debug menus and typing in the command prompt. So I disabled it again and the second xFi pod has been disabled and won't reconnect. I can't seem to find any information online regarding what type of virus this is. Malwarebytes doesn't seem to be picking anything up.

On the first look, the amount of security problems seems to be low. Detecting and fixing a single security problem in a month seems to be a relaxed situation.

A closer look will show, that the most interesting information is missing. It's the duration how long the CVE bug was open in the system. To explain the situation better a *gantt chart* make sense.

The drawings on top shows the standard situation. The security team has fixed in Jan an issue, has fixed another issue in Feb, a third one in March and also one at end of April. In the second drawing the duration how long the bug was open is extended to two month. The interesting situation is, that the same amount of bugs is fixed. The first one at end of Jan, the second in February and so on. But if we are measuring the area in all the bugs it is more.

The situation becomes more obvious, if the duration of each problem is extended more. Now the situation is, that at any point in time four unsolved problems are remaining in the system, no matter if in each month one of the problems get solved. From the end-users perspective the workflow in the first drawing is equal to a secure software while in the last drawing the software is highly insecure, because many unfixed problems are in the system.

To determine if a software project is secure or not, two information are needed. How many CVE bugs are fixed in each month, and secondly, how long does each CVE issue stays in the system.

&amp;nbsp;

I hope everyone is doing okay with everything that's been going on.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been building an app to help with my own IR work, and I've created a new timeline feature I'm really excited about and think will be useful for other analysts. But it'd be very useful for me to get some input from others to make sure I'm on the right track. It's part of the new release of the Perseus Incident Response Splunk App I built and spoke about at Splunk .conf19. It's up on the Splunkbase and comes pre-loaded with data you can explore from real-life investigations that were conducted using Perseus: https://apps.splunk.com/app/4638

&amp;nbsp;

If you have an opportunity to take a look and share some candid feedback, I'd greatly appreciate it. Perseus has helped me significantly with my own IR work, but I'd love to get input from other analysts on how I can make it even more useful.

&amp;nbsp;

While I think playing with the Splunk App is the best way to get a feel for Perseus, if you aren't in a position to test out the app but are still willing to share your input, I have a video of how I used the newest dashboard in an investigation of a server infected with ransomware that employed anti-forensic techniques on disk: https://youtu.be/haLcPIIZyo4

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think playing with the Splunk App is the best way to get a feel for Perseus, if you aren&amp;#39;t in a position to test out the app but are still willing to share your input, I have a video of how I used the newest dashboard in an investigation of a server infected with ransomware that employed anti-forensic techniques on disk: &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/haLcPIIZyo4""&gt;https://youtu.be/haLcPIIZyo4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for any feedback you can give!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

,ComputerSecurity,"Hello everyone,

I'm new here on reddit, a friend suggested I would get some good raw advice here. I apologize in advance if this is not the correct place to ask.

I've created a pretty powerful remote control tool that could be used for good or bad depending on the person running the server and holding the code. It's difficult to compare my product to something like TV, or LMI because of the malleablele functionality you can create yourself based on scripts you already know how to write in a host native OS.

I have no intent to use my service for the dark side, I merely created it because I work in a field supporting many clients where I got sick of the products available such as TeamViewer. Someone asked me, ""How do I know you're not using it for a botnet or something"".

That's a damn good question...but it also made me think of the possibilities of solving very large equations with many computers who might opt into contributing to a greater cause in some instances. On the dark side of that, it could be used maybe for shady illegal activities. You might have heard about the project folding proteins (to find a cure for COVID-19 and others disease) by donating your GPU resources while your machine is on, while I don't understand the calculations behind the scenes, it does sound pretty amazing.

Having a need to test with many different Windows users, how does the admin/creator convince the end-user you're not trying to do anything malicious? What ways could keep an administrator accountable for their own actions within the system if an admin can delete their own logs?

I feel a lot of companies would want to control their own server, but that means I'd have to obfuscate the code and license it so it doesn't get ripped off, but even then...I'm sure it's still possible to reverse engineer for someone who is persistent.

Your thoughts and comments are welcomed and appreciated, good or bad as long as they are constructive, please. I personally have done a lot of credit card recovery for POS with full visibility for many years and pass a background check with flying colors, my credit is also good (not sure that would matter). I just don't know if that's going to be enough.

**1)** There's nothing you can do.

**2)** You might be able to extract the hex values of the old password after lots of screwing around and this might or might not do you any good.

**3)** This one hacker / lab / researcher / university IT dept. broke the password on $otherHardDriveByOtherManufacturer by doing XYZ, but every manufacturer and sometimes even drive model implements this sort of thing differently so good luck trying to apply this and four times out of five they needed the master password.

**4)** This expensive Windows software will *maybe* just do it for you.  Also someone sells some piece of hardware that might do it for $10,000 and data recovery labs have those.  Anyway, if you pay a lab thousands of dollars, they might be able to help (this isn't out of the question, just I like to hack things and we'd like to NOT spend thousands if we can avoid it).

**5)** There is a master password which may still work. I believe it's 32 spaces, but based on the ouput of hdparm -I, I think it's been changed though?  And I've read contradictory things that say maybe it can only be used for a secure wipe anyway?

Is there any thing I'm missing?  Any tool out there I haven't managed to hunt down?  It's really weird to be googling this and find a bunch of old pages and forums that say ""You're SOL, there's nothing you can do!"" and a bunch of other old pages and forums that say ""breaking these is pretty easy, you just need X expensive Windows tool.""  It sounds like most of the people cracking them are just using the Master Password, and I think mine's been changed?

,ComputerSecurity,"Is there a secure way to delete a file?

My understanding of the files are saved to a disk is that the operating system takes a set of bytes, which constitute a file, and then writes that set of bytes to whatever sectors of disk are available, keeping track of which parts make up that set of bytes. When the user wants to load that data again, the operating system looks up which sectors have that set of bytes and then it reconstitutes that file.

Because this is an abstraction of a file, deleting a file doesn't really delete it. The data is left on disk but the record of that file is deleted, so that when a request is made to write another file (i.e. set of bytes) to disk that space can be used.

The security issue, then, is that a file that was considered deleted, still may reside on disk, even though the operating system doesn't recognize it as a normal file.

Is there a way to wipe just that data, or obfuscate it on disk? FWIW, disk encryption is of limited value here because, theoretically, a hostile actor could force the device owner to give up the necessary credentials.

\-----------------------

**UPDATE**

So for more context I was looking for a solution for consumer OSes. This means for macOS: HFS+ and APFS. For Windows 10: NTFS. Since all my devices are on some sort of SSD, the advice that was for spinning hard drives doesn't apply.

I wasn't interested in wiping the entire drive, just specific files without having to do a reformat/migration.

Something like `shred` would have been awesome BUT I'm not on Linux. I might try use the Windows tools recommended below, but this article convinced me that it might not matter. I'll have to rethink my own security strategy. Thanks everyone!

**UPDATE 2**

u/Secure4Fun alluded to it below but I glossed over it. Essentially enabling TRIM on an SSD makes it ""extremely difficult"" to recover files. So, running an SSD and whole disk encryption gets you what I need.

&amp;#x200B;",t2_byjlv,False,,0,False,"How to ""shred"" digital files",[],r/ComputerSecurity,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ftien0,False,dark,0.92,,public,17,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,17,,False,False,,1586760081.0,,[],{},,True,,1585814617.0,text,6,,,text,self.ComputerSecurity,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a secure way to delete a file?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My understanding of the files are saved to a disk is that the operating system takes a set of bytes, which constitute a file, and then writes that set of bytes to whatever sectors of disk are available, keeping track of which parts make up that set of bytes. When the user wants to load that data again, the operating system looks up which sectors have that set of bytes and then it reconstitutes that file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this is an abstraction of a file, deleting a file doesn&amp;#39;t really delete it. The data is left on disk but the record of that file is deleted, so that when a request is made to write another file (i.e. set of bytes) to disk that space can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security issue, then, is that a file that was considered deleted, still may reside on disk, even though the operating system doesn&amp;#39;t recognize it as a normal file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to wipe just that data, or obfuscate it on disk? FWIW, disk encryption is of limited value here because, theoretically, a hostile actor could force the device owner to give up the necessary credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-----------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for more context I was looking for a solution for consumer OSes. This means for macOS: HFS+ and APFS. For Windows 10: NTFS. Since all my devices are on some sort of SSD, the advice that was for spinning hard drives doesn&amp;#39;t apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t interested in wiping the entire drive, just specific files without having to do a reformat/migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something like &lt;code&gt;shred&lt;/code&gt; would have been awesome BUT I&amp;#39;m not on Linux. I might try use the Windows tools recommended below, but this article convinced me that it might not matter. I&amp;#39;ll have to rethink my own security strategy. Thanks everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

Then I tried YouTube with the same results. Then I tried Reddit, still only a bunch of &amp;quot;How&amp;quot;s and no Whys. Why would a hacker want to steal your passwords. How would you answer this to a teenager that sees that they have nothing to lose?&lt;/p&gt;

I thought this might be of interest to viewers here:

In this video we’ll take a look at two example email messages – one legitimate, and one not-so-legitimate. We’ll learn which header fields are most commonly referenced for analysis, how to determine a message’s true origin, how to read SPF and DKIM information, and we’ll even take a quick look at DMARC. Whether you’re completely new to this concept or a seasoned veteran, this episode has something for you.
