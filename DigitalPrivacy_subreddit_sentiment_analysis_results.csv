"new to this subreddit  and the concept in general  i have several questions  hi  i found this subreddit by looking up how to essentially delete my digital footprint  i know there are services that do that  but i m broke  which will be a common theme in this post   i m a paranoid person as it is  and i have faint memories of growing up with internet anonymity in the old days of the internet  now it feels like everything i ve ever thought and googled are tied to an online persona of me  i just kinda accepted it for a while because it s so normalised now  i want to delete my digital footprint so that i can reinvent my online persona  so that future employers or anyone who i might want to impress don t see the old persona of a younger dumber me  then i stumbled onto the rabbit hole of internet privacy  i want the private parts of my life to truly be private  for example  going to parties or events that may not be universally acceptable by the professional world  i m not committing any crimes  i just want privacy  i have a lot of discussions about mental health and disabilities that i don t want employers to see and use against me  etc 

anyways  enough rambling  if anyone has any advice for the above mentioned about removing my digital footprint while broke  i know it will be tedious to do myself and not perfect  but i digress  i would be happy to hear suggestions  i dipped my toes into the concepts and jargon of internet privacy  and although i a small background of tech that allows me to understand a bit  some of it still feels like another language to me  i understand the          eyes concept etc  is there a  explain it like i m five  resource for this community 

unfortunately  my family are ios users  so i feel like i may be at a disadvantage compared to windows android users  since most of my tech has been gifted to me by family  i dont have a good job and a lot of money due to disabilities but that s a coversation for another time  i have seen some options for alternatives to mac os  but not much for phones  i m also afraid that jailbraking my iphone will void any kind of warranty service  since it s provided to me via a company my family works for 

is firefox truly private  i used to use firefox when i was younger  mainly because foxes are my favorite animal  when i got new computers that had other browsers downloaded  i just resolved to using them  i would love to go back to firefox  but if it isn t truly private  then i would rather not  

i don t know any programming language  i learned a small amount of html when i was younger to make cool profiles on various websites  but html seems pretty obsolete now  do i have to know programming to be able to efficiently use privacy software and services  

  
and finally  how can i be sure that recommended services and softwares are truly private  i don t just want to download all this stuff blindly  and just end up not having the privacy i expected  or have my data stored on these things to be used against me later if the government someday decides  hey i want to make private software illegal  all that data is ours now   do these services regularly wipe data  do they just not recieve the data in the first place  can anyone provides sources on the credibility of the softwares  can someone provide realistic scrutiny of these softwares  ",Positive

it got my eye cause it seems like surfshark doesn t pull info from the hibp api  so you get a bit more proactive protection and email notifications if your data is compromised  you get a report that breaks things down into database breaches and malware attacks  

they found mine in some major ones like canva and deezer  plus gave which data is compromised

"aura credit monitoring   my experience after a breach like millions of others  i was involved in two very high profile data breaches this year that left me feeling exposed and vulnerable to identity theft and financial fraud  this prompted me to investigate aura and specifically aura credit monitoring  

while there are tons of tools and services in this field  aura really stood out because it offers a comprehensive suite of tools  and the most robust identity theft coverages that i ve seen 

i ll do a quick overview of aura credit monitoring and talk about my overall experience 

  aura overview

  located in the united states
       customer support via phone or live chat
     day money back guarantee
    best price       month for individual plans  but you need to use the coupon below or it s     month

  aura discount coupon on all plans     https   www aura com deals coupon   off  https   cybersecuritydeals org aura deals 

  aura credit monitoring tools

   features     description   
       
 credit monitoring provides credit surveillance of three major credit bureaus  equifax  experian  and transunion   
 dark web monitoring scans the dark web for leaked user data and reports back if your identity has been compromised   
 identity monitoring monitors personal and financial data to stop potential identity theft   
 financial transactions monitoring scans for suspicious activities in your credit  banking  and investment accounts   

aura credit monitoring offers real time surveillance of three major credit bureaus  if any changes or inquiries are made  you ll be notified immediately  you ll also be sent monthly credit scores and an annual credit report 

  intuitive and secure monitoring service

aura has a minimalistic interface  and it runs very well on both android and pc  its dashboard allows you to easily 

  access and review credit information
  monitor your credit status
  lock your credit file with experian creditlock
  receive immediate alerts on any financial transaction

aura uses two factor authentication for extra protection  in case your account has been compromised  aura s identity theft insurance will help you recover  you can use it to   cover up to    million per user in identity theft expenses    this is better than some similar identity protection services that i tried  

  additional security tools  beyond credit monitoring 

   extra features     desctiption   
       
   antivirus    ai enhanced app that scans for  and removes malware 
   ad blocker    you can block trackers and ads with this browser extension for chrome  edge  and firefox  
   child protection   a suite of tools to ensure a safe digital environment for children 
   fraud calls protection   protects users from spam calls 
   experian creditlock   locks your experian credit report 
   lost wallet remediation   quick way to cancel lost credit or debit cards 
   password manager    stores passwords and warns if they re weak 
   vpn   no logs vpn service for online privacy and anonymity 
   vault     gb of secure cloud storage 

although aura offers a lot of additional features  some of them are a bit disappointing  for example  its vpn app only lets you connect to us servers  which is very limiting  luckily  i have protonvpn  so this wasn t a big drawback for me  on the other hand  aura has a very solid password manager that i use every day  lost wallet remediation seems very useful  but i hope that i will never have to use it  

  aura subscription plans

aura offers multiple pricing plans depending on the number of users and devices  

   plan     device protection     identity theft insurance   price    with coupon  
             
   individual         million    month 
   couple          million     month 
   family    users          million     month 

  this aura coupon gives you a discount on all plans     https   www aura com deals coupon   off  https   cybersecuritydeals org aura deals 

i think that aura s plans are reasonably priced compared to lifelock  aura credit monitoring is much better  as it covers multiple bureaus  even if you choose an individual plan  to get the same service from lifelock  you will have to spend a lot more money  

  pros and cons of aura

   pros     cons   
       
 great antivirus not the cheapest monitoring service 
 dark web monitoring  
    million insurance policy  
 multiple subscription plans  
      customer support    
   bureau credit monitoring offered in all plans  
 inclusive credit monitoring and identity theft protection  
 vpn  password manager  vault included  
 parental control app  

all in all  i think that aura credit monitoring provides exhaustive protection in this day and age  i ll definitely continue using it  so far i haven t had any issues or alerts with regard to my credit  if nothing else  i sleep better and have peace of mind after two massive data breaches exposed my data  including social security number

"what s the best encrypted email service  so  i m a longtime gmail user who has finally had enough of their invasion of user privacy  i m tired of ads in my inbox and knowing every email can be read by google and anyone else they give access to  hi nsa    

in my search for the best encrypted email service  i ve tried out several providers over the past few months and i m looking for some outside opinions on which one to choose 

     proton mail seems to be the best encrypted email service

i ve been using the  mail plus  plan of proton mail to fully test out all the features and so far i m loving it  the interface is very similar to gmail  yet it offers much better security  

i don t like how pgp doesn t encrypt the subject line and email address  outside of that  i ve been pretty impressed with it  oh  and you can easily bundle proton mail with other proton solutions like vpn  drive  password manager  etc  here s my rundown of proton mail 

  falls under swiss jurisdiction
  uses end to end pgp encryption
  saves all emails on encrypted servers
  tracking links protection feature removes any tracking pixels
  self destructing emails maintain your privacy
  easy switch lets you quickly migrate emails
  comes with an app for android and ios 
  proton also offers a vpn  calendar  mail bridge  and drive  data storage 
  with their mail bridge option  you can use proton mail with third party email clients
  file storage         gb  depending on your plan 
  price       month  see the     offer via the link below 

  proton mail     off deal     https   proton me mail special offers  https   securitycoupons org protonmail deal 

     startmail   private and intuitive encrypted email

startmail has a very minimalistic interface and feels super secure  however  one drawback is that it lacks a dedicated app for smartphones  on the plus side though  it integrates seamlessly with mail clients i ve tried on desktop and mobile  so no worries there 

here s my overview 

  based in the netherlands
  encrypts email directly on the server with end to end pgp encryption
  create disposable emails with email alias feature
  convenient email migration thanks to smtp and imap support
  powerful spam filter
  gdpr compliant  excellent for user privacy 
    day trial period
  email storage          gb
  price        month

  startmail     off coupon     https   www startmail com offers coupon    https   securitycoupons org startmail deal 

     tuta email   uncompromising encryption  for better or worse 

tuta may have the best encryption out of all email providers on this list  however  it offers no support for classical protocols that allow you to import emails  i would recommend it if you have the patience to start from the beginning  i found this bothered me too much and moved on after a week  

  located in germany
  combined aes and rsa encryption allows them to encrypt even address and subject line
  no pgp support  can t send emails to alternative services that use it 
  can t import email as there s no smtp  imap  or pop support
  available across multiple platforms
  has a free tier that can take up to  gb of emails
  file storage        gb
  price       month

     mailfence

i ve been using a free version of mailfence on my android  it is super intuitive  and i love that it has a bunch of additional tools that you d expect 

  based in belgium
  supports open pgp encryption  making it compatible with most third party services
  customer support available via phone or email
  supports payment with crypto
  easy import thanks to pop  smtp  imap  and exchange activesync support
  offers calendar  file storage  and groups
  free tier with  gb of storage
  storage         gb
  price       month          

     posteo

if you re looking for an encrypted email provider on a budget  posteo is a good choice  it uses layered encryption  which definitely works really well  email migration is also convenient  but i wish that it included custom domains   

  german based email service
  combo of openpgp and s mime encryption
  follows a strict no logs policy  uses ip stripping and dane security protocol
  has a spam filter and email aliases
  copy emails from up to   email accounts
  you also get calendar  notes  and contacts features
  no trial or free tier
  storage       gb
  price     month          

     mailbox   org

mailbox is a direct competitor to posteo  i found that its encryption is a bit weaker  but on the other hand  it contains a complete productivity suite  while there is no app  it has support for third party clients   

  located in germany
  servers use pgp encryption on data at rest
  easy to migrate from other services
  additional tools like calendar  drive  address book  portal 
  no trial  but there s a    day refund policy
  storage        gb
  price     month          

     runbox

runbox is another gdpr compliant  email service that caught my attention  overall  it lacks a few features like a calendar and notes that i would expect  it also doesn t have a dedicated app  which is not good   

  based in norway
  supports pgp  no full integration though 
  longstanding  but dated service
  mtp  imap  and pop support lets you just copy everything when switching
  can make up to     email aliases
  offers    gb of file storage
     day trial period and    day refund guarantee
  storage       gb
  price       month

as i already mentioned  i m still not sure which encrypted email service is best among the bunch  at this point i am planning on using proton mail as it seems to be the best option  and i like how i can also utilize other proton products like vpn and drive  what are your thoughts  ",Positive

"delete me review for data removal service i have some relatives in the states who noticed a big increase in spam calls emails after the at amp t and other data breaches earlier this year  as they are a bit older  i thought i d introduce them to data removal services  cause they are not very tech friendly and weren t aware that these services existed 

we tried out deleteme  and there are a couple of things to note  maybe it will be helpful to some of you  there weren t that many reviews  so i thought i d share 

  you need to be patient to notice results  because they are doing the work of deleting your data for you  it might take a while  i set it up a couple of months ago  and recently asked about the number of spam calls my relatives received  so they mentioned it s significantly less  but there s still some coming in  
  it only will cover data in the usa   if your data is sold somewhere else  it will most likely not get removed  
  it s quite an expensive option in comparison  i thought we d give it a try to see if it s maybe better in some way  but having used other providers like incogni  i didn t notice any difference  

overall  deleteme is a relatively good service for removing your data in the us  it gets the job done  however  having tried other options  i am including them here as well  just so you can find the best online data removal service for you  privacy bee doesn t have phishing detection and a family plan  so that s why i prefer incogni personally 

 data removal service incogni privacy bee deleteme

"nordpass vs lastpass    which performs the best  i was looking for a secure password manager that is also relatively affordable  after some research  i found that many users have heavily recommend these two services 

going into this i was a bit biased given that lastpass has been involved in various  security breaches  https   krebsonsecurity com         experts fear crooks are cracking keys stolen in lastpass breach   over the years  meanwhile  nordpass has a solid reputation so far as i can tell  so here s the rundown  

  general overview

   category     nordpass     lastpass   
          
   headquarters   panama us  
   free version   yes    account  yes 
   encryption   xchacha   aes     bit 
   support        live chat email 
   price   from       mo  from       mo  

nordpass relies on newer and faster encryption to protect its users  it is also more affordable with a long term plan while providing constant access to customer support 

lastpass is based in the us  which is very problematic from a privacy standpoint  us is a member of five eyes alliance and frequently shares user data with other countries 

  platform support

   platforms     nordpass     lastpass   
          
   desktop   windows       linux  macos          chromeos windows         linux  browser only   chrome os  browser only

   browser   firefox  opera  safari  edge  chrome firefox  opera  safari  edge  chrome 

both password managers are available on many different devices  however  nordpass can be found on more operating systems 

  main features

   category     nordpass     lastpass

   premium features   real time data breach monitoring  data breach scanner  password strength checker  encrypted data sharing  emergency access dark web monitoring  emergency access  advanced mfa  priority customer support  security dashboard 

nordpass allows you to directly import passwords from more password managers  making the setup much smoother  it s autofill feature was also much faster 

  security  amp  encryption

nordpass uses xchacha   encryption  which is faster and more secure than aes     lastpass was hacked a few times since      and has struggled to regain trust from its users 

  plans  amp  pricing

   payment method   credit cards  debit cards  google pay  amazon pay  crypto  paypal credit cards  debit cards 

  customer support

   faq section   yes yes 
        live chat   yes no 
   support ticket   yes yes 

lack of      customer support means that you will have to wait a bit more if you experience technical difficulties while using lastpass 

all in all  nordpass seems much more secure and convenient  while also being affordable ",Positive

"incogni vs optery   which gives the best results  over the last few months  i have been using optery and incogni   two popular data removal services  both of them have a pretty good success rate  and were recommend to me by a bunch of redditors 

my goal was to figure out which one provides a better service by thoroughly exploring all of their features  so  let s start 

  quick overview

   category     optery     incogni   
          
   based in   united states  california  amsterdam  the netherlands  
   availability   the us canada  the isle of man  iceland  lichtenstein  norway  switzerland  the eu  the us  the uk 
   coverage        data brokers      data brokers 
   support   live chat  email  email  and knowledge base email and detailed knowledge base 
   monthly price         mo           mo        mo          mo  

  optery   combines manual and automated data removal  it has a greater coverage  but is exclusively available only in the us  it is more affordable than incogi with their cheapest plan 

  incogni   provides completely automated data removal and is very easy to use  it relies on algorithm predictions to figure out which brokers have your data  it is located in the netherlands  which is one of the best privacy jurisdictions around  although its services are also available in europe  incogni covers fewer data brokers compared to optery  

  data removal

   category     optery     incogni   
          
   method   automated and manual automated  algorithm anticipates which brokers may hold your information 
   detailed reports   yes no 
   repeated removal requests   yes yes 
   custom removal requests   yes no 
   privacy regulations   ccpa ccpa  gdpr  pipeda 

  optery   has a three step removal process  it locates the sites that have my data  sends removal requests  and continues monitoring the web to ensure that my data doesn t resurface  optery also gave me the option to send custom removal request  which is only available in ultimate plan   while this may be useful for some  i found it a bit tedious and i decided to rely more on the algorithms  

  incogni   focuses on convenience through automation  its algorithms predict which brokers have my personal data and then sends removal requests  

  ease of use  amp  reliability

  optery   has a very organized interface that gives you insight into every step of the removal process  it gave me detailed reports  which also included screenshots 

while not as detailed    incogni   has a more intuitive and minimalistic interface while it provides reports  it didn t tell me what type of user data it found  without this  i couldn t exactly gauge how useful it is 

  pricing 

   optery plan     monthly price     annual price     removal from   
             
   free basic   free free   
   core         mo       mo     sites 
   extended          mo         mo       sites 
   ultimate          mo        mo      sites 

  optery   has well defined subscription plans  depending on which you choose  you can also expect unlimited custom removals  detailed reports  and priority for customer support  note that core plan only provides automated data removal  to really get the most out of it  you will have to go for extended or ultimate plan 

   incogni plan     monthly price     annual price   
          
   individual          mo         mo  
   family  amp  friends up to   people           mo         mo  

  incogni   provides the same features in each plan  the only difference being how many users it covers   it keeps everything simple  which is refreshing 

  customer support

   category     optery     incogni   
          
   refund policy      day money back guarantee    day money back guarantee 
   customer support   guides  help desk  live chat  email  social media email  knowledge base 

all in all  i d give advantage to incogni  i love the fact that it is completely automated and available outside the us   despite having lower coverage  i found that its pricing was reasonable  optery also looks great though  and may be a good option if you don t care about all the non us websites that are listing your data

"incogni vs privacy bee   which is better  i ve been looking at data removal services and decided to put incogni and privacy bee under the microscope  these are both popular data removal services  but they work quite differently  here s what i found 

  edit update    i ended up going with incogni simply because it s a better value and i didn t want to fork out      for privacy bee  i used incogni s promo for     off here   https   incogni com coupons   off  https   cybersecuritydeals org incogni deal   off 

  quick overview 

   category     incogni      privacy bee   
          
   based in   amsterdam  the netherlands  atlanta  georgia  the us  
   availability   canada  iceland  the isle of man  lichtenstein  norway  switzerland  the uk  the us  the rest of the eu  the us

   support        email support chatbot  email  blog 
   price         month         year         month       year  

one of the biggest differences i noticed right away is that there is a   huge cost difference between privacy bee and incogni   

  incogni   provides fully automated data removal  although it covers fewer brokers  it has a global reach and is also available in the eu and canada  it is based in the netherlands and is partnered with surfshark  popular high end vpn service  

  incogni also has a promo for     off here     https   incogni com coupons   off  https   cybersecuritydeals org incogni deal   off 

  privacy bee   mainly focuses on the us  it has better coverage  but it is also much more expensive  the company is situated in the us  which is slightly problematic from privacy standpoint  

  data removal

   repeated requests   yes no 

as mentioned    incogni   is completely automated  so you can just set it and forget it  you can see weekly updates to check on the progress  i found it to work well so far in my tests over the past few months 

  privacy bee   gives you detailed and easily understandable reports on your current privacy status  it can process between     data deletion requests per day  privacy bee also lets you select which brokers it should focus on 

  security and privacy

  incogni   lacks extra features  but it offers an affordable and streamlined service  at a great price  

  privacybee   comes with additional security tools like vulnerability scanner that will give you tips on how to improve your security

   refund policy      day money back guarantee none 

what makes   incogni   convenient is its    day refund policy  you can try it out for free and cancel if you aren t satisfied with its performance 

  privacy bee   gives you a free risk assessment  but you will have to get a full plan to try out its features  currently  there is only an annual plan  which is about       there is a pro rated refund in place  if you cancel after   months  you will get half of money back

"bitwarden vs nordpass   which password manager is best  due to recent data leaks  i ve become increasingly worried about my privacy  this is why i started looking into secure password managers  many users mention nordpass and bitwarden  so i ve decided to do a detailed comparison of both services

   price               mo  
   free version   yes    device  yes 

  nordpass   is made by nord security  which also created nordvpn  in       it is based in panama   one of the best privacy jurisdictions  

  bitwarden   is an open source password manager that was started in       it is based in the us and is a member of the five eyes alliance  which is not ideal  however  it supports more browser extensions

   username generator   yes no 
   ease of use   intuitive interface less user friendly 

  nordpass   very easily imported all of my old passwords  it supports services like lastpass   password  keepass  etc  its auto filling feature is also very fast   

  bitwarden   allows you to import passwords but isn t nearly as intuitive  auto filling works  but isn t as streamlined

  nordpass   uses cutting edge   xchacha     encryption to secure all passwords  it can generate   passwords that are        characters long   and consist of uppercase and lowercase letters  symbols  and digits  you can also use nordpass to create passphrases  which are easier to remember while providing same security 

  bitwarden   relies on  a bit slower    aes     encryption    however  its   passwords can contain     characters   and use whatever combination of characters you like
