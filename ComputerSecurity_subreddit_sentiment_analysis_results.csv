"linux thinkpad kernel backdoor how the thinkpad lmi kernel module could be exploited as a backdoor

the thinkpad lmi kernel module  which is part of the linux kernel s platform support for lenovo thinkpads  interfaces with the firmware to expose certain low level hardware features  specifically  it allows for control over fan speeds  battery thresholds  and other system management features through the sysfs interface  while these features provide useful control over hardware  they can also introduce a potential attack surface when misused or left exposed 

   overview of thinkpad lmi module

the thinkpad lmi kernel module provides an interface for interacting with the thinkpad s embedded controller  ec  or other system management components  it is designed to give the user control over various hardware functions that would typically only be accessible through firmware level settings 

some of the key features include 

fan speed control

battery charge thresholds

power settings adjustments

bios version querying


the module exposes these settings through the  sys class  or  proc acpi ibm  interface  which allows users or scripts to read and modify system level information directly 

   potential for backdoor exploitation

the nature of the thinkpad lmi module s access to low level system components makes it a potentially attractive target for malicious actors if security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations exist  here s how it could theoretically be exploited as a backdoor 

a  privilege escalation via sysfs interface

the thinkpad lmi module operates at the kernel level  and while it should only be accessible by root  misconfigurations in user permissions or sysfs exposure could allow unprivileged users to manipulate the system s behavior 

for example  if an attacker gains access to the sysfs interface  they could modify critical parameters like fan control  causing hardware damage  overheating  or even throttling performance  more dangerously  they could attempt to control power related settings or modify bios related configurations  depending on the specific setup  it might be possible to disable certain security features or tamper with the boot process 

b  malicious kernel module injection

in systems where module loading is not tightly controlled  an attacker could potentially replace or modify the thinkpad lmi module with a malicious version  a backdoored version of this module could hide its activities  intercept kernel calls  or provide attackers with covert control over hardware functions  since the module interfaces with hardware management  an attacker could stealthily disable fans  tamper with power management  or even influence battery behavior to create more significant hardware issues 

c  remote access via firmware manipulation

some configurations exposed by thinkpad lmi could allow control over firmware updates or hardware settings  particularly if the thinkpad s firmware allows remote management  a malicious actor with control over the kernel module might manipulate these settings to execute arbitrary firmware updates or exploit known vulnerabilities in lenovo s embedded firmware  this could open up a remote access channel to the system  bypassing traditional software based security controls like firewalls or antivirus tools 

d  persistence across reboots

the fact that thinkpad lmi interacts with system firmware means that it could be used to create persistence for a backdoor  by manipulating settings like bios boot order or secure boot settings  an attacker could create conditions where their malware or rootkit is reloaded on every boot  in addition  altering fan or power settings could allow the attacker to control when the system overheats or throttles  potentially avoiding detection by monitoring tools that don t expect such behavior 

   securing against exploitation

to mitigate the risks of thinkpad lmi being exploited as a backdoor  several best practices should be followed 

a  limit access to sysfs interface

ensure that only the root user or trusted processes have access to the sysfs interface exposed by the thinkpad lmi module  this can be done by tightening file permissions and using tools like apparmor or selinux to enforce strict access controls on kernel modules and hardware interfaces 

b  monitor module loading

disable or restrict kernel module loading unless it is strictly necessary  if possible  use modprobe d configurations to blacklist potentially dangerous or unnecessary modules  furthermore  monitoring the integrity of modules like thinkpad lmi should be part of a regular security audit to detect any unauthorized changes or tampering 

c  bios and firmware updates

regularly update your thinkpad s bios and firmware to patch known vulnerabilities that could be exploited through the thinkpad lmi interface  additionally  disable remote bios management unless explicitly needed  and always enforce bios passwords and secure boot features to prevent unauthorized modifications 

d  kernel hardening

use kernel level hardening techniques such as kernel address space layout randomization  kaslr  and restrict direct memory access  dma  from untrusted sources  applying these security features can help mitigate the impact of any successful exploitation of thinkpad lmi by making it harder to escalate privileges or maintain persistence in the system 

e  monitor for anomalies

monitoring system logs for unexpected fan speed changes  power settings modifications  or bios update attempts could provide an early indication that something is amiss  regularly audit access to the  sys class  or  proc acpi ibm  directories to ensure no unauthorized processes are attempting to interact with low level system management components 

   conclusion

while the thinkpad lmi kernel module provides useful functionality for thinkpad users  it also opens up a potential avenue for exploitation if not properly secured  by exposing hardware management features through the sysfs interface  attackers may find ways to escalate privileges  inject malicious code  or persist through reboots by manipulating firmware and bios settings  therefore  it s crucial to implement strong access controls  keep firmware updated  and monitor for unusual activity to reduce the risk of this module being used as a backdoor 

if you re running linux on a thinkpad  it s worth reviewing how the thinkpad lmi module interacts with your system and applying appropriate security measures

sorry for this question  but i am not techie enough to understand this 

short version  is it possible that an attacker can read data via wifi without beeing visible 

long version 

wifi traffic is secured using an encryption key  the wifi password   so actually everybody can read the traffic with a capable device  but no clear data is readable  since its encrypted 

but when an attacker has the wifi password  he could join the wifi network and read decrypt the traffic 

but     can an attacker also read the clear text data  without joining the wifi network  maybe this imagination does not apply  but isn t the data not just  s and  s flying through the air

"imagined ir  crowdstrike incident  humour    incident response report  the great blue screen debacle  



date  july         

incident  widespread bsod  blue screen of death  outbreak

root cause  crowdstrike falcon sensor update gone rogue



  executive summary   

on this fateful day  our it department inadvertently published a digitally   optimized code    this later on caused chaos upon our unsuspecting workforce  what was supposed to be a routine crowdstrike falcon sensor update turned into a blue tinted nightmare  leaving our employees staring helplessly at screens that resembled a clear summer sky   minus the sun  clouds  and any semblance of productivity 

fortunately  we had the foresight to get an intern to do the publishing  he is now out of a job 

  detailed timeline   

      am  it team initiates the crowdstrike falcon sensor update  blissfully unaware of the impending doom 

      am  first reports of bsods trickle in  it team dismisses them as  user error   because it s always easier to blame the users 

      am  bsods multiply faster than rabbits in springtime  panic ensues 

      am  it team realizes this is not a drill  they frantically google  how to undo a software update  and  nearest bunker locations  

      am  emergency response team assembled  consisting of three interns  a potted plant named fred  and whoever could be bribed with promises of extra coffee 

      am  after numerous failed attempts and one inexplicable incident involving a stapler and a banana  the team successfully rolls back the update 

      pm  systems gradually return to normal  employees emerge from their hiding spots  blinking in confusion at their now functioning computers 

root cause analysis 

the crowdstrike falcon sensor update  designed to protect our systems  apparently decided that the best defense was a good offense   against our own computers  it s like hiring a bodyguard who then proceeds to knock you unconscious for your own protection 



  lessons learned   

   always test updates on a sacrificial computer first  preferably one belonging to that guy in accounting who keeps microwaving fish in the break room 

   keep a stack of board games in the office for emergency entertainment during extended outages 

   invest in stress balls and meditation apps for the it team  they re going to need it 



  preventive measures   

   implement a  buddy system  for software updates  one person to click the update button  another to hover over the  undo  button 

   develop a bsod early warning system  possibly involving carrier pigeons or smoke signals 

   consider reverting to typewriters and abacuses for critical business functions 



  conclusion   

while this incident caused temporary disruption and a spike in blood pressure across the organization  we can all take solace in the fact that it provided an excellent team building experience  nothing brings people together quite like shared digital trauma 

remember  in the immortal words of a wise it sage   have you tried turning it off and on again

hi everyone 
this is my first attempt in a flutter project    i used a concept i had in a project for university  feedback will  be welcomed  

it s practically impossible to keep track of all our passwords and account names 
the obvious alternative would be using only one password  which would lead to serious security problems 
the common solution to his problem is to use a password manager but even that raises concerns 
most password managers require the usage of a database to store every password to facilitate usage  that leaves the users in an awkward position where they have to trust the service to keep their information safe and to inform them in case of a breach 
our solution is a stateless password manager where we can generate random passwords in a replicable manner so they won t be stored in a database 
the user is asked for optional parameters like website  username and a master password  from which it will generate a replicable password secure and strong against most types of attacks

"database obfuscation and anonymization framework  is it worth it  i am writing this post there because there could be   people who have the same pain   in the neck with   database obfuscation    i would love to see   any feedback about design and solution    i got a few questions that would love to hear from you  if you wish to have a deep dive about it read the passage after the questionary   
the questions to consider are 

  is data   obfuscation   is hot topic in your experience 
  do you see   value   in obfuscation tools and frameworks for data obfuscation 
  should the development and research in this area   continue   in your opinion 

  details are below     
  i have been working as a database administrator   for almost a decade and have spent a vast amount of time in database obfuscation while delivering safely anonymized dumps from production to the staging environments or providing it for analyzing purposes for analytics  and i was always struggling with a lack of technology in this area  that s why i started to develop this project on my own using my experience with understanding the pros and cons of the current solution and developing something that would be extensible  reliable  and easily maintainable for the whole software lifecycle   
  mostly the obfuscation process was   

  build   complicated sql   scripts and integrate them into a kind of service that is going to apply those queries and store the obfuscated data
  confirm the obfuscation procedure with the   information security team  
    maintain the schema changes   during the whole software lifecycle

the main problem is each business has   domain specific data   and you cannot just provide transformation for every purpose  you just can implement basic transformers and provide a comprehensive framework where users can design their obfuscation procedure  in other words obfuscation it s also a kind of software development and it should be covered with all features that are used in ordinary development  ci cd  security review  and so on    
after all  i   collected   the things that would be   valuable   in this software 

  the only reliable schema dump must be performed by the   vendor utilities  
  customization   possibility to   implement your transformer  
  validation   possibility to   validate the schema   you are obfuscating
  functional dependencies transformation   possibility to perform   transformation   when one column   value depends on another  
  backward compatible and reliable   i want to have strictly the same schema and objects from production but without original valuable information

  and i started to develop    greenmask  https   github com greenmaskio greenmask         
greenmask is going to be a core of the obfuscation system  currently  it is only working with   postgresql   though a few other dbms are on the way 

i d like to highlight the key technological aspects that define greenmask s design and engineering 

  greenmask   delegates schema dumping   and restoration to pg  dump and pg  restore  while it handles table data dumping and transformation autonomously 
  designed fo  r full compatibility with standard postgresql utilities    to achieve this  i undertook the task of porting a few essential libraries 
       copy format parser    while initially considering using the csv format and the default go parser  i encountered issues related to null value determination and parsing performance  despite these challenges  this approach ensures nearly      compatibility with standard utilities  allowing you to effortlessly restore dumps using pg  restore without any complications 
       toc library of postgresql    one of the primary challenges we faced in this project was the need for precise control over the restoration process  for instance  you might want to restore only a single table instead of an entire massive database  after extensive research  it became clear that using the pg  dump pg  restore in directory format offered the best control  however  there was a gap in available go implementations for this functionality 
  the core design philosophy   revolves around customization   because there is no one size fits all solution suitable for every business domain  greenmask empowers users to implement their own transformations  whether for individual columns or for multi column transformations with functional dependencies 
  greenmask transformers   offer multiple customization options    including 
     implement your   custom transformer    in go or python  with pipe interaction using formats like json  csv  or text 
       using templates    which include pre defined go template functions and record template functions  enables you to create multi column transformations in a way that resembles traditional imperative programming 
       using cmd transformers    allows you to interface your data with external programs written in any language and facilitate interaction via formats such as json  csv  or text 
  greenmask has   integration with postgresql driver  pgx     it was designed to make the tool powerful and customizable  in my point of view transformation is engineering work and for doing that you should use an appropriate tool set for doing whatever you want  perform schema introspection and initialize table driver that could encode and decode raw column data properly
  via data that was gathered during schema introspection  greenmask notifies you about   potential problems via warnings    it verbosely says about potential constraint violation or other events for your awareness

this project started because of   experiences   and the fact that there weren t many tools available  it s being developed by a small group of people with limited resources  so your feedback is incredibly valuable  an early beta was released about a month ago  and getting ready to release a more polished version in mid january  

  if you re interested in this area    you can check out the project and get started by visiting   github page  https   github com greenmaskio greenmask

"is modern dma  last     years to now  against an otherwise secured computer still a threat  while people frequently mention cold boot attacks  i have found shockingly little information on dma attacks  and the information i have found tends to be fairly useless itself since many of the ways people talk about it are either incomplete  contradictory or focus on aspects which wouldn t affect an otherwise protected modern system   there might be a more prevelant technical conversation around it  i m just referring to what the average person can actually find with some educated googling  

dma  at least as i understand it  should represent an existential threat to computer security  it should have become a major discussion after things like thunderbolt were introduced widely onto consumer hardware but    certainly    now that usb     is similarly vulnerable and becoming a part of an open standard   which  some  governing bodies have taken it upon themselves to begin legislating as mandatory   i said  begin   put down your  um actually  s    despite this however  i ve found very few recent mentions of it at all  and none  that i can remember  outside of explicitly tech security focussed conversations that the majority of people would never see  i would understand radio silence if it was because these attacks were something extremely involved like a cold boot or extremely niche and didn t affect the vast majority of hardware or if it had been patched for a while now and most people weren t vulnerable anymore  but as far as i can tell none of that is true  

while amd and intel have developed some mitigations  i ve seen those mitigations as being mentioned as spoofable   i e  the device can lie about what it is to bypass them  thunderbolt specific   i e  they don t protect anything other than thunderbolt  incomplete   i e  it s still possible to perform a dma attack  and poorly rolled out supported   i e    only fairly recent devices are protected and even many modern devices that could be and should be protected still aren t for one reason or another  be it that their bios wasn t updated to allow for it or because it just isn t enabled or whyever else  unfortunately  i don t how how much  if any  of that is true or not since i feel like incomplete protections would be more frequently reported  but i also feel like this is something that should have had programmer asses in seats pulling overnighters to get it protected against a decade ago so i honestly have no idea  

so  what is the actual state of dma attacks currently  let s assume the drive is already encrypted  the screen is already locked   or it s in sleep or something similar so the key is in memory but you can t send commands to it  it s running a completely updated stock linux kernel   i don t think distro should matter here but if it does you re free to assume whichever one you want  and it s a recent device  so the data is secure if the machine crashes  you can t input any commands  it s got all of the os patches it should have  and it was made in the last     years or so   so it s hardware is from after windows adopted support for kdmap and protections should  theoretically  have been in place for a while now  let s also assume it s a desktop with free pcie slots and thunderbolt and firewire  so every dma avenue is theoretically avaliable    and    the user has not intentionally changed anything in the bios uefi   and it does have a case lock but you have bolt cutters and a hammer because if you re doing a hardware attack and didn t think to prepare for hardware protections you re too dumb to even know what a dma attack is in the first place  

so  given a recent  well secured machine that has ports which would  in theory  be dma vulnerable  what is the actual state of dma attacks in the present day  are the modern protections good enough and prevelant enough to be taken as granted  or are even fairly modern machines still vulnerable  are there ways to further protect machines specifically against dma  if so  why aren t they already enabled by default  is there some tradeoff for it or is it just laziness   basically i m just asking in general what is the current state of things regarding dma ",Positive
"sec scandal    amd security revelation   years ago  i never heard about it  was this real  what finally happened  what was the resolution of this   

   from the excellent site      security week    https   www securityweek com security firm under fire over disclosure amd chip flaws       

amd is  investigating claims that its processors are affected by more than a  dozen serious vulnerabilities  and the company that found the flaws is  facing backlash over its disclosure method

israel based cts labs on tuesday published a report claiming that it has found     critical vulnerabilities and backdoors  https   www securityweek com researchers find critical security flaws amd chips    in amd s epyc  ryzen  ryzen pro  and ryzen mobile processors over the  course of six months  only a high level description of the security  holes has been made public  but amd was informed of the flaws only one  day before disclosure  

  the vulnerabilities   

cts labs has set up a dedicated  website  https   www amdflaws com    and assigned names to each type of vulnerability it has found   according to the company  the security holes mostly affect amd s secure  processor technology and they can be exploited for arbitrary code  execution  bypassing security features  stealing data  helping malware  become resilient against security products  and damaging hardware 

the vulnerability class dubbed masterkey by cts labs  can reportedly be exploited to deploy persistent malware inside the amd  secure processor  but exploitation involves installing a malicious bios  update  these flaws can be used to bypass firmware and software security  features  including the firmware trusted platform module  ftpm   secure  encrypted virtualization  sev   windows defender credential guard  and  microsoft s virtualization based security  vbs  technologies  masterkey  can be leveraged to steal network credentials and cause physical damage  to targeted devices  cts said  

the ryzenfall vulnerabilities  which affect ryzen  processors from amd  in the worst case scenario  can be exploited to  take complete control of the secure processor  attackers can leverage  this to plant malware that cannot be removed by traditional security  solutions  researchers said  

fallout vulnerabilities affect the boot loader  component of the secure processor in epyc cpus  exploitation requires a  digitally signed driver supplied by the vendor  attackers can leverage  fallout to plant highly persistent malware  disable bios protections   steal network credentials  and bypass security mechanisms  

the last class of vulnerabilities has been dubbed  chimera  these are backdoors in amd s promontory chipsets  which are  used in ryzen and ryzen pro workstations  the backdoors  found in both  the firmware and the hardware  can be exploited to execute malicious  code inside the chipset s internal processor  cts said  these backdoors  were reportedly introduced by asus subsidiary asmedia 

exploitation of all the vulnerabilities requires elevated privileges to the targeted machine  

  impact and comparison to meltdown spectre   

security firm ensilo  which published an  faq  https   www ensilo com faq chimera ryzenfall fallout masterkey   shortly after cts labs made available its report  compared the vulnerabilities to  meltdown and spectre  https   www securityweek com search google meltdown   and   spectre query meltdown   and   spectre amp cx                        a mcx eenlzi amp cof forid  a   amp sitesearch  amp safe off   which impact cpus from intel  amd  arm and others  however  some argued that the issues disclosed by cts labs are  nowhere near as severe   https   www reddit com r amd comments    o c amd security flaw found in ryzen epyc chips  due to the fact that they mostly impact amd s secure processor technology rather than the hardware itself  

 dan guido  https   twitter com dguido status                    s       ceo of trail of bits  said his company reviewed cts labs  technical  report and confirmed that the vulnerabilities exist and that the  proof of concept  poc  exploits work  but admitted that all flaws  require administrator privileges for exploitation  trail of bits was  paid by cts labs to review the findings  

researcher  arrigo triulzi   https   twitter com cynicalsecurity status                     called cts s report  over hyped beyond belief  and a  whitepaper worthy of an  ico  https   en wikipedia org wiki initial coin offering     triulzi  pointed out that if an attacker obtains elevated privileges  and is able to perform malicious bios updates and load unauthorized  code  they would not need to exploit these vulnerabilities in order to  gain complete control over a system  

triulzi  admitted that the chimera vulnerability  could pose a problem  but only  if you are a government agency   cts  noted in its report that it may not be possible to directly fix this  bug  and it may require a workaround or a recall of the product  

  controversial disclosure   

amd was only given one day to prepare for cts labs   disclosure and the company says it has launched an investigation   vendors are typically given months to fix or mitigate these types of  flaws  in the case of meltdown and spectre  affected companies were  given roughly half a year to work on patches  

 this company was previously unknown to amd and we  find it unusual for a security firm to publish its research to the press  without providing a reasonable amount of time for the company to  investigate and address its findings    amd stated  http   ir amd com news releases news release details view our corner street     

while cts labs has not released any details and  claims no technical information will be made available any time soon to  prevent abuse  its methods have been called into question  

 the way that cts labs chose to publicly identify  vulnerabilities they discovered in amd chips is a case study in what not  to do when you discover a software or hardware weakness in the wild    jon bottarini  technical program manager at hackerone  told  securityweek   responsible disclosure should be the prime directive for  security researchers  and by only allowing amd    hours to respond  before cts labs notified the press  cts stood to do more harm than  good   

many potentially serious  vulnerabilities  https   www securityweek com intel chip flaws expose millions devices attacks    have been found in similar intel technologies over the past year  but  in most cases they were responsibly disclosed to intel and the company  started working on patches before disclosure  

on the other hand  cts s unorthodox disclosure method may have been driven by financial motives  

 although we have a good faith belief in our analysis  and believe it to be objective and unbiased  you are advised that we  may have  either directly or indirectly  an economic interest in the  performance of the securities of the companies whose products are the  subject of our reports   cts labs noted in its  report  https   safefirmware com amdflaws whitepaper pdf   

a  controversial company   https   www moneyweb co za in depth investigations viceroy unmasked  named viceroy research published its own report following cts labs  disclosure in an apparent effort to short amd stock  

 in light of cts s discoveries  the meteoric rise of  amd s stock price now appears to be totally unjustified and entirely  unsustainable  we believe amd is worth       and will have no choice but  to file for chapter     bankruptcy  in order to effectively deal with  the repercussions of recent discoveries    viceroy research said  https   viceroyresearch org            amd the obituary    

in addition to the findings  some have  called into question  https   www reddit com r hardware comments    xks some background information on the new amd    the credibility of ctb labs  a company founded in       and its  founders  claims regarding other firms they launched and worked for

we still have an issue with the url on email due to content filtering and so we started digging further into this and this is related to content filtering  it turned out that the content filter providers endpoint security providers have a common that they maintain their own database which has detection date  web classification  before and after  and expiry date 

then we found  virustotal which aggregate of the endpoint security providers that can see the status of the url against each provider  last week  we found       phishing malicious found and today down to      found   some we have to report manually to do the false positive and some seem automatic 

my questions are 

  if we are not reporting this manually to do a false positive  will each system lift the ban after the expiry date  my assumption is   weeks in this case    back to normal

i m on macos and was wondering if any of you have experience with parallel desktop to create linux vm  is it safe  if i want to open a file or a link without being sure what s inside  would you recommend it   


for sure the best option would be tails on a usb stick or something  but i just wanted to know if any of you are using parallel desktop with a specific setup maybe

it is a wlan device  this is for sure  but the question remains  which one

   password for password management 
  all my logins other than  password and google will have randomly generated passwords and totp tokens  when possible  stored within  password 
   password and google will share a memorized password and use shared yubikeys    on my keyring    at home    in a safe deposit box  for  fa

      in the catastrophic event that i lose all devices logged into  password  i ll need to log in to google and download decrypt the  password secret key

  separate guest network with convenient qr code for sharing
  separate iot network

potential points of failure 

  using the same password for both  password and google

"how many brute force attempts per second are allowed on android when the attacker have a physical access  when i tried to enter a long passphrase to protect my android phone i was shocked that there is a too small limit for the passphrase length   only    characters 

this is enough only for   or   words  if the passphrase contains words  

why such a weak passphrase  is there a mechanism that limits the speed of the brute force attempts  i did not noticed a strong key stretching  the phone is unlocked momentarily when i enter the passphrase   is there a hardware module that keeps the encryption key and limits how many attempts to guess the passphrase are performed 

how feasible is to circumvent the user interface in order to make unlimited number of guesses or to extract the key for decryption  if it s not encrypted  

if we assume there is a hardware module that keeps the encryption key how the key is stored  does it stored in a cleartext and the module is checking the passphrase by  if   passphrase user input    recorded passphrase   then get the key    or the key is encrypted with the passphrase  i hope it s the latter and a some key stretching is used to limit the brute force attempts in case the encrypted key is extracted somehow  but is it really so ",Positive

"reddit thing   investigating a cheap wifi digital photoframe acting suspiciously https   www reddit com r hardwarehacking comments v px t i need to convince a picture frame to reveal its  utm source share amp utm medium web x amp context  

from the op
 i m not sure if this is the best subreddit to ask this question or not  but i need to get access to the data partition of a device to analyze its contents  the device is a skylight picture frame running an rk     with an unknown android os  locked down  guessing version      i m interested in inspecting the device because it s happened to either pick up or was shipped with a nasty addon from china  i m not sure how  common  this sort of business is from a picture frame  i know there was a thing with insecure picture frames before but this is my first actual find 

basically  this picture frame seems to be monitoring network traffic of any user connected network  it then reports randomly sized encrypted payloads back to several different adups servers on every initial connect and on a random schedule thereafter  this wouldn t really be that suspicious  except that it s scanning for and attempting to connect to any wifi network with a weak password and an internet connection in the background  it will connect to any ssid using any number of dumb weak passwords  i m guessing from an internal table  if it doesn t get an internet connection within    seconds  it moves on to the next network  all the while  the android ui just insists that there s no network connection possible although it can see networks  likely because something in the background has stolen the radio   additionally  it scans and connects to any insecure bluetooth devices nearby  but i don t have a way to intercept its communications currently  i suspect the bt component could be used for wiretapping  though the range is abysmal because a circuit trace is the antenna 

skylight support immediately played quiet when asked how to access their device to assess the malware and  are talking to our senior developers to figure out a fix   the  senior developers   i m sure in china  also denied any possibility of getting inside the storage of this  i m suspicious that they may have knowingly shipped this with malware  or added it after the fact and i would like to prove it  i split the frame open since i was pretty sure it would just be a generic board like a pi inside  possibly with serial pads or other development options  however  i don t know what i m looking at or if it will meet my goals  there are otg dp and otg dm pads next to the micro usb port  a usb a port  a  v barrel connector and a large number of unmarked pads around what appears to be an expansion ribbon connector spot

"do search engines bots register data from a website s ssl certificate  i am setting up a private web server  for professional work use  for customers  colleges etc 

i also need an ssl certificate to run encrypted ssl  and i would like to explore the possibility of really certifying that this site is truly connected to me  and not to an imposter  by purchasing an extended validation  ev  certificate from a certificate authority  ca   

 ev  means the ca will go to great    length to really verify that i am the physical person i claim to be  before them  it s kindof like opening a bank account  so an ev ssl can really be trusted as belonging to whoever it says it belongs to  verified by a ca 

an ev certificate also means that the information about the certificate owner  me  will appear close to the padlock icon in the visitor s web browser  a so called green icon  and the certificate will of course hold my name in it plus some additional data about me  this is thought to act as authentication that it is me and my server

question i was looking over my junk email and i noticed i got an email from fb security team notifying me that someone was or had logged into my fb from another location using another device i didn t recognize  i checked the email handle and it came from facebookmail com which google says is an email that facebook uses  the thing being is the facebook account was supposed to be deleted as i m trying to defacebook myself  i tried logging back in but got an invalid user and id  this makes sense as the recovery time for a deleted facebook has passed  i checked my password on the facebook account in my bitwarden and it s a    character randomized by bitwarden and it had  fa enabled when i requested that fb delete it  the delete recovery time expired more than   months ago  i did a recover password using the email that i received the alert too  it pulled up a facebook account  the spelling of the name on the account matched the spelling of my name in the email salutations as it had an oddly placed special character in the name  i had them recover the password but they asked me to verify another email that i didn t recognize that had an aol handle on it  i m trying to determine if someone just put my email into their account as a recovery or if the old account wasn t deleted properly  i m pretty good about using  fa on my bitwarden and using randomly generated passwords for all my social media  also all the social media is locked down with only friends or family on it to prevent scrapping  i also reviewed my old junk emails and found just   other email from facebookmail com saying someone else tried to log into my facebook  i also avoid using public wifi without a vpn  any suggestions

  in this scenario which will be more difficult for an attacker to penetrate   pf or iptables   or are both equal in this particular area    

i am asking this question because i am planning to setup a home made router  amp  i am not sure if i should install openbsd or opnsense  which also uses pf  or ipcop  which use iptables   i will be using linux on my desktop which the perimeter firewall is suppose to protect ",Positive

"having a hard time investigating recovering from server hack  hi everyone  for context  i m a sysadmin with a decent understanding of offensive hacking  and i run a few lamp servers on digitalocean for personal niche websites and a few clients  websites  a couple months ago i put all my domains on a bug bounty  openbugbounty org  to help me identify weaknesses as i continue growing   i ve had only minor exploits mentioned  and most of the researchers violate the rules i wrote  ie  dont attack subdomains  don t report self xss  etc    since this started  i would occasionally see my mysql server drop  maybe twice a month  i would reboot my server and all would be well  in retrospect i see how dumb this attitude was   i ve also begun getting a ton of log traffic  as one would expect 

here s where i make a huge embarrassing mistake  i decided to use my main production server to host the development environment for a new version of a cms i wrote in php mysql  i was working on dev   mysite   com  which was on the same server as mysite   com  and used the same mysql server  i really can t explain my thinking on this one  at my     i m very strict about having the developers keep dev and production environments separate  so this is out of character for me  i guess my level of security consciousness is proportional to the amount of explaining i ll have to do 

about a week or ago i find my cms won t allow me to login  i checked the db and there are hundreds and hundreds of new entries in the  users  table  interestingly  the user account i was trying to login with looked untouched  i obviously got caught slipping with a sqli vulnerability  no other tables were affected that i know of  as this cms uses an un privileged db account  i shut the dev site down  and moved it to a local lamp server on my home network  better late than never  now i m trying to figure out what happened  and how far the breach went 

i have over       log files in  var log apache   and most other directories in  var log  are also packed to the gills  there s too much noise  presumably  from the bug bounty for me to analyze anything  i spent a day writing python scripts to analyze stuff  i have one that compiles all website specific logs into respective master files  and runs scalp py on them  outputting everything to an html file i can navigate  there s so many random injection attempts that the script is almost useless to me  i wrote another script to analyze the  var log auth log file and at least count and sort the types of messages  the output can be found  https   pastebin com grght qx  https   pastebin com grght qx    sorry if the output is confusing  i don t understand what a lot of the messages mean  so just did a basic count for now 

i only saw on single ssh login that i didn t recognize  and it was on the account smmsp  this also lead me to see in my mail log files that somebody had found an old forum install i forgot about  and had been using it to send massive amounts of spam emails to email addresses in russia  i ve removed the account  the forum  and uninstalled sendmail 

i m at the point of the investigation where i risk going down the wrong path and wasting valuable time 

so here s my questions 

   are there any programs that will do an in depth audit of my logs  i did a bunch of searching  but almost nothing fits the bill besides scalp py  and that s only for website specific log files  i m more than happy to expand my own scripts to do this if i need to  but would request someone push me in the direction of the information i need to start studying 
   is there an application that could blacklist an ip address if it recognizes injection attempts  i m sure a waf could pull something like this off  but have never used any so i would be swinging in the dark by picking one  i can write a script to do it too  using the logs to identify ips  but is there a specific method of blacklisting that i should be leaning towards if i need to do this on my own

the main problem i can see with this approach is that it is kind of difficult to maintain dozens of email addresses  i m pretty sure google auto deletes gmail accounts after     years of you not logging in  so you d need to manually log into each email address occasionally  also if you are talking to customer service and they ask you for your email address  you might not be able to remember unless you follow an obvious naming convention

"never seen anyone report this security flaw in the last    years   note this is an edit  to hopefully better explain what i was talking about here  

phishing is very common  and not only that  very easy to detect    someone sends you an email that attempts to get you to click a link that will send you to a site that looks like the login screen for a popular site like ebay  amazon  microsoft  etc 

what i have never seen discussed very often at all in the last    years or talked about is another possible security flaw    what if someone purposely sets up a real website    key word is real    not a phish  not a fake  not a copy of a popular site    instead they set up a real site and this site is run by a hacker or a group of hackers 

a  hacker could use this trick   they create a legitimate website    say a  computer gaming website    they require people to create an account to  access the website  where people have to enter an email and a password     they delete or edit the password file  so that people trying to login   will see  your password is incorrect and get a message  try again       so someone trying to login to the legitimate website  will  cycle thru  all their passwords  

a possible  real  scenario of someone trying this     for example  if you want to hack into steam accounts  this is how i would do it     st  get a list of upcoming planned to be released games on steam    nd  check for a soon to be released game where there are no fan websites yet     rd  create a fan website for the upcoming to be released game   prior to the games release date       th  make sure you require people to create an account to use your fan site   th  now after the game is released  people buy it and may search for information on how to play the game  and they will go to your site and type in an email and password to create their account   th  you as the hacker and site administrator  do what i suggested in the paragraph prior to this one 

this is just an example scenario    the security flaw  is that phishing is very easy to detect  but how would you know if your favorite site   think of any site you visit every day   is actually being run by a hacker or group of hackers      maybe when you go to search for information on the game that you just purchased  that site is being run by a hacker 

phishing is very easily detectable    but how would you detect if it is actually a real site    how would you know that this real site is being run by a hacker or group of hackers     this is the crux of the matter and where there is some security risk if people don t consider this could happen ",Positive

  encryption decryption is handled by cryptsetup with the veracrypt extension
  starting the hidden os is done by booting a usb drive with another esp and  boot installed to it  which is assumed to be kept safe 
  the main disk by itself can only boot the decoy os  which should offer plausible deniability
  each os is theoretically isolated from the other
     the decoy esp and  boot on the main disk are mounted as read only on the hidden os
     the usb drive should be removed when starting the decoy os

   sandboxing

    memory unsafe languages such as c or c    as opposed to rust

   code reuse attacks like rop or jop

   loading a malicious library on disk or by dynamically modifying executable code in memory

   uninitialized memory

   kernel lacking in security

   abundance of ways for an attacker to retrieve the sudo password

and i quote the author   the hardening required for a reasonably secure linux distribution is far greater than people assume  you will need full system mac policies  full verified boot  not just the kernel but the entire base system   a strong sandboxing architecture  a hardened kernel  widespread use of modern exploit mitigations and plenty more

i m taking a cybercrime module on my masters  and i love it  my lecturer is a memey legend  and it s super interesting  but i m basically the jen of it crowd  and come from a neuroscience background  so i understand computers as much as i understand    idk  obscure philosophy or smth  this cybercrime module has people from my criminology msc course  but also from another engineering course  with many computer science engineering grads  you can imagine the dichotomy  i realised my lack of knowledge when i quickly got lost in the tutorial today  despite spending hours of my life doing reading prep  a lot of my coursemates from my course want to drop out  but i am determined to persevere and to learn goddamnit but i need your help reddit

see  i asked a couple of questions but they got completely ignored  press f  because  i think  people just thought they were really stupid questions  accurate   i spent most of the lesson frantically googling terms like mfa and vm that my coursemates were dropping

there were also several  progressively less secure  layers of using it i wasn t sure about 

   simplest was going to be straight usb connection 
   they also allow you to connect to it as a wireless hotspot to print  as opposed to it connecting to a local network for all devices to print   i guess at that point it has no internet connection so no worries 
   there is some mobile app you can get to allow you to print from a mobile device  i assumed this was the least secure

"secure guest computers my wife operates a business  and as we are preparing to move to a new commercial space  we are planning to expand our offerings which will require customers to use computers connected to  d printers  vinyl cutters and laser cutters and similar equipment   i want to start thinking about ways to secure these machines 

we plan to place these machines on a network separate from our company machines  but are there any recommendations for securing the machines connected to the cutters and printers either to be limited to the applications we install on them and protect them from viruses as i suspect people will want to connect a usb stick to them to take their designs with them or download files from the internet to create their files   i was thinking software that would completely restore the machine to a known good installation to reduce the likelihood of viruses and malware 

any recommendations on software  hardware or other things we should look at ",Positive

"security concept  virtual machines vs hardened linux in your opinion  what would be best practice for security on your computer 

   a host os  linux or windows  just with my files and virtual machine software  each application runs in its own vm  most vms are rolled back to initial snapshots after work  needed files are routed into vm 
   a baremetal linux hardened with tools like selinux  apparmor etc 

  pros on option    softwaresettings are safed in the vm so that my vms run like expected on every machine  also moving to a new computer or factory reseting the computer is simpler  no need to configure anything  also each application is in its own sandbox  so you can control what files it sees  if its connected to the internet  you can use snapshots  convinient for rolling back malware or settings
  negs on option    much more diskspace is occupied  backups are more complex or last longer  sometimes there are flaws in the vm software like vmware  this slows working down  
  pros on option    you use the whole hardware of your computer and dont have to assign ram and cpu cores to different vms and limit each application  more power efficient 

  rational  in my opinion option   would be more secure because of the compartmentalization and simple when moving or resetting the machine  but you use    x more diskspace  limit the hardware  
  emotional  option   feels lighter and faster  even if powering up a vm snapshot only last    seconds longer then opening firefox directly  this feels huge  but i also feel less secure on option   because every application has internet connection  has access to all files  and hardening all this might be more complicated then set up vms 

currently i am using option   with windows as host os  next step would be to cut the host os from the internet  but this means using a vm with wsus server to get updates for windows  other option would be to use linux as host os 
but often it feels just burdening and slowing down my work  especially if i just want to look up something  or just look for mails 

lets discuss  i am looking forward to hear your thoughts  facts and how you secure your computer from spying software  zero days or malware

"how secure is my password algorithm  hi 

i just did some brainstorming and came up with a fun side project  i want to do some kind of unique password manager  my idea is to randomly generate passwords using some kind of master key  instead of encrypting passwords and storing them somewhere 

let s say i have a function that generates a  random  password using a seed  it s important that the function will always generate the exact same password for a given seed 

    def generate pw seed  

now my idea is to save some id s like this permanently  for each account  you d add a new id 

    ids     steam    ts     insta  

when starting the password manager the user is prompted to enter the master key  the program will then  randomly  generate all the passwords by concatinating each id with the master key and using the result string as the seed  

so if the master key is        it would generate a password for the id  steam  with the seed  steam      also  it would always show the same passwords without storing them on the hard drive  i can only think of brute forcing all possible master keys to calculate the passwords  but how is the brute force algorithm supposed to tell the right passwords apart from false ones  generated with a wrong master key  they all look like  randomly  generated strings  so as long as the intruder has none of the correct passwords i can t think of a way to easily hack this system  but i feel like there is a reason why there are no systems that work like this  am i missing something

 gt i m extremely concerned that a website that deals with any sort of financial transaction  even if those transactions are handled by paypal  would store passwords as plaintext  many many people reuse passwords from website to website  so if someone were to grab a list of user passwords off your server they would likely be able to then hack many customers on other websites and cause them actual damage  

 gt industry standard is to store not the passwords themselves but a string that has been generated by a process called salting and hashing  then when a user attempts to log in you run their password through the same function and compare the output string to the obfuscated string stored in the database  you can hire a computer security expert to implement something for you  and the price will be much less than lost business revenue goodwill if there is a major leak  ",Positive

the idea would be to partition an external hard drive usb  if i had my choice i would go with something like     gb ssd usb  with part of the usb being set up as a persistent usb with windows    enterprise to match our pcs  although a case could be made for kl   the other part would be memory to store the investigation files that would grant access to the persistent usb side  as i can safely download the reported emails and their attachments as well as any reported malware software programs  interested in thoughts and opinions  also if you have any other ideas  again i am trying to limit exposure as much as possible  so me downloading the emails on my laptop and opening them  or me downloading potentially malicious programs to investigate is what i am trying to avoid ",Positive

the situation becomes more obvious  if the duration of each problem is extended more  now the situation is  that at any point in time four unsolved problems are remaining in the system  no matter if in each month one of the problems get solved  from the end users perspective the workflow in the first drawing is equal to a secure software while in the last drawing the software is highly insecure  because many unfixed problems are in the system 

to determine if a software project is secure or not  two information are needed  how many cve bugs are fixed in each month  and secondly  how long does each cve issue stays in the system  the interesting situation is  that for open source projects only the first information is available in the  mitre  database  but not the duration  this information is missing  that means  the end user isn t able to determine if the software is secure or not ",Positive

"convincing end users that you don t have malicious intent  hello everyone 

i m new here on reddit  a friend suggested i would get some good raw advice here  i apologize in advance if this is not the correct place to ask 

i ve created a pretty powerful remote control tool that could be used for good or bad depending on the person running the server and holding the code  it s difficult to compare my product to something like tv  or lmi because of the malleablele functionality you can create yourself based on scripts you already know how to write in a host native os 

i have no intent to use my service for the dark side  i merely created it because i work in a field supporting many clients where i got sick of the products available such as teamviewer  someone asked me   how do i know you re not using it for a botnet or something  

that s a damn good question   but it also made me think of the possibilities of solving very large equations with many computers who might opt into contributing to a greater cause in some instances  on the dark side of that  it could be used maybe for shady illegal activities  you might have heard about the project folding proteins  to find a cure for covid    and others disease  by donating your gpu resources while your machine is on  while i don t understand the calculations behind the scenes  it does sound pretty amazing 

having a need to test with many different windows users  how does the admin creator convince the end user you re not trying to do anything malicious  what ways could keep an administrator accountable for their own actions within the system if an admin can delete their own logs 

i feel a lot of companies would want to control their own server  but that means i d have to obfuscate the code and license it so it doesn t get ripped off  but even then   i m sure it s still possible to reverse engineer for someone who is persistent 

your thoughts and comments are welcomed and appreciated  good or bad as long as they are constructive  please  i personally have done a lot of credit card recovery for pos with full visibility for many years and pass a background check with flying colors  my credit is also good  not sure that would matter   i just don t know if that s going to be enough 

thank you for taking the time to read my post  please let me know if i left anything out ",Positive

       there s nothing you can do 

       you might be able to extract the hex values of the old password after lots of screwing around and this might or might not do you any good 

       this one hacker   lab   researcher   university it dept  broke the password on  otherharddrivebyothermanufacturer by doing xyz  but every manufacturer and sometimes even drive model implements this sort of thing differently so good luck trying to apply this and four times out of five they needed the master password 

       this expensive windows software will  maybe  just do it for you   also someone sells some piece of hardware that might do it for         and data recovery labs have those   anyway  if you pay a lab thousands of dollars  they might be able to help  this isn t out of the question  just i like to hack things and we d like to not spend thousands if we can avoid it  

       there is a master password which may still work  i believe it s    spaces  but based on the ouput of hdparm  i  i think it s been changed though   and i ve read contradictory things that say maybe it can only be used for a secure wipe anyway 

is there any thing i m missing   any tool out there i haven t managed to hunt down   it s really weird to be googling this and find a bunch of old pages and forums that say  you re sol  there s nothing you can do   and a bunch of other old pages and forums that say  breaking these is pretty easy  you just need x expensive windows tool    it sounds like most of the people cracking them are just using the master password  and i think mine s been changed

"how to  shred  digital files is there a secure way to delete a file 

my understanding of the files are saved to a disk is that the operating system takes a set of bytes  which constitute a file  and then writes that set of bytes to whatever sectors of disk are available  keeping track of which parts make up that set of bytes  when the user wants to load that data again  the operating system looks up which sectors have that set of bytes and then it reconstitutes that file 

because this is an abstraction of a file  deleting a file doesn t really delete it  the data is left on disk but the record of that file is deleted  so that when a request is made to write another file  i e  set of bytes  to disk that space can be used 

the security issue  then  is that a file that was considered deleted  still may reside on disk  even though the operating system doesn t recognize it as a normal file 

is there a way to wipe just that data  or obfuscate it on disk  fwiw  disk encryption is of limited value here because  theoretically  a hostile actor could force the device owner to give up the necessary credentials

"how do i responsibly dispose of my old desktop computer  a family member built a desktop computer for me about   years ago and unfortunately  i believe it is time for it to go  i know desktops can be updated and whatnot  but i really don t need it anymore  i honestly wanted it because i thought my interest in computers would be more significant than it really was  and i simply do not need it 

i opened up the tower  and well    she s not the prettiest in there  i never did anything to update this computer in the   years i ve had it so i doubt the parts are worth anything  nor could i even tell you what they are 

does anyone know of places in the us where i can safely dispose of this tower  i just want to get rid of the tower and all the parts inside  not the monitors  i know best buy takes laptops  but when i called them  the employee on the phone didn t seem to know if they could take the whole tower  any suggestions of how i can dispose of this responsibly ",Positive
